### 1. INTRODUCTION

**_Macroeconomics_**
This is the branch of economics that attempts to analyze and explain the interrelationships between
aggregate (totals) variables such as output, employment, interest rates, money and prices in the
economy. These are the key variables that determine economic activities and level of national
income in an economy. Macroeconomics therefore analyses the performance of the economy as a
whole.
Macroeconomics deals with the following:
(i) Total output of goods and services (GNP). GNP is the value of all final goods and
services produced by nationals of a country irrespective of where they are
producing it.
 What determines the GNP level?
 Why is it that GNP grows at a lower rate in some years than in others?
(ii) It measures GDP. GDP is the total sum of expenditure on _final goods and services_
produced in an economy. It includes all consumers’ expenditure on goods and
services, except for the purchase of new houses which is included in gross _fixed
capital formulation._
(iii) Total employment and unemployment levels
 What proportion of total population is unemployed?
 What determines levels of unemployment?
(iv) General price level
 Shows cost of purchasing by a typical consumer
 Estimates inflation and anticipated effects
(v) Balance of payment problem
(vi) Exchange rates

**_RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MICROECONOMICS AND MACROECONOMICS_**

**Microeconomics**
 Deals with the behaviors of individual economic units. These units include consumers, workers,
investors, and owners of land, business firms, infant, any individual or entity that plays a role in
the function of our economy.
 Microeconomics explains how and why these units make economic decisions. For example, it
explains how consumers make purchasing decision and how their choices are affected by
changing prices and income
 It also explains how firms decide how many workers to hire and how workers decide where to
work and how much work to do.
 Another important concern of microeconomics is how economic units interact to form large
units-markets and industries. By studying the behavior and interaction of individual firm and
Consumers, microeconomics reveals how industries and markets operate and evolve, why they
differ from one another, and how they are affected by government policies and global economic
conditions.

**Macroeconomics**
By contrast, macroeconomics, the other major branch of economics, deals with aggregate economic
quantities, such as the level and growth rate of national output, interest rates, unemployment and
inflation.

 But the boundary between macroeconomics & micro has become less and less distinct in the
recent years. The reason is that macroeconomics also involves the analysis of markets for goods
and services and for labor.
 To understand how these aggregate markets operate, one must first understand the behavior of
the firms, consumers, workers, and investors who make up these markets. Thus
macroeconomists have become increasingly concerned with microeconomics foundation of
aggregate economic phenomena and much of macroeconomics is actually an extension of
microeconomic analysis.

**_The major goals of Macroeconomic Policy_**

1. Full employment
   - Unemployment is where some resources are not optimally utilized and are lying idle.
     Full employment is favored because the greater the level of employment, the greater the
     amount of goods and services available in the economy. It is also argued that the burden
     of unemployment and loss of goods and services fall disproportionately on people who
     are without jobs.
2. Price stability
   - Inflation should be avoided at all costs so that prices remain stable and predictable over
     time. This is important because inflation affects other people more adversely than
     others. For example, people whose incomes rise more rapidly than prices and those who
     are able to borrow at relatively low interest rates prior to inflation benefit from
     inflation.
3. Economic growth
   - Economic growth takes place when real output increases more rapidly than the increase
     in population, thus with economic growth the society has more goods and services at its
     disposal and a correspondingly higher standard of living.
4. External balance
   - If a country has a favorable balance of payment (BOP), its foreign exchange reserves will
     increase, hence can import the much needed capital for investment. Unfavorable BOP
     would lead to an outflow of foreign exchange to finance the trade deficit

**_Importance of Macroeconomics_**

1. Facilitates estimation of GNP, which aids in the analysis of the economy’s performance;
2. Facilitates the study of the nature and size of material welfare of the society;
3. Knowledge of macroeconomics is important in economic policy formulation by governments.
   For example we are able to understand how aggregate variables like GNP, wage rate,
   consumption, savings, investment, interest rates etc, will be affected by a change in government
   expenditure, tax policy, monetary policy, foreign exchange rates,
4. It predicts the impact of exogenous variables on the endogenous variables.

**_The limitations of Macroeconomics_**

1. Macroeconomic theory treats the aggregate it deals with as internally homogenous and
   overlooks the significance of internal composition and structure of such variables
2. It tends to make generalizations about the whole economy based on small samples, yet the
   samples may not accurately reflect the overall picture. The propositions that are true for
   individuals or small groups are not necessarily true for the economy.
3. The aggregates may not be functionally related. In such a case, the macroeconomic policies that
   are formulated will be erroneous. For example, aggregate consumption will only be useful for

```
analysis if it is functionally related to levels of income, wealth interest rates, capital gains,
relative prices, money stock, attitudes and expectations, consumer credit, etc
```

4. Aggregate models that may be derived to explain the behavior of the economy may end up not
   conforming to the real world. For example, the bulk of the macroeconomic theory developed so
   far has been relevant to developed countries since most models have been constructed in those
   countries. These models are far from reality in developing countries

### 2. NATIONAL INCOME, OUTPUT AND EXPENDITURE

**Learning Objectives**
At the end of the lesson the student should be able to:

```
 Explain fully the various concepts of national income.
 Appreciate the importance of compiling national income figures.
 Use national income figures to compare the standards of living over time and between
countries and know the problems involved.
 Explain fully why national output and employment fluctuate around their long term trends
 Show how the country can manipulate its resources for faster growth using the relationship
between income, consumption and savings.
```

**_National Income_**
National Income is a measure of the money value of goods and services becoming available to a
nation from economic activities. It can also be defined as the total money value of all final goods and
services produced by the nationals of a country during some specific period of time – usually a year

- and to the total of all incomes earned over the same period of time by the nationals.

**_The circular flow of income_**
The circular flow model describes the flow of resources, products and incomes among economic
actors. For simplicity, consider an economy with only two actors; households and firms. They
interact in a circular pattern as in the diagram below

The households

- Supply resources (land, labor, capital and entrepreneurial skills) to the resource
  markets and receive earnings for those resources
- Demand goods and services from the product markets. make payments for those goods
  and services using the incomes they receive
  The firms
- Demand resources from the resource markets for production of goods and services
- supply goods and services to the product markets

Products and resources flow in a counterclockwise direction while payments for these items flow in
the opposite direction

## Households Firms

## Product

## Market

## Resource

## Markets

The above case assumes an economy with no government and does not participate in foreign trade.
However, many countries trade with others and also have governments that actively participate in
the economic activities. Thus in such an economy there are 4 actors; Households, firms, government
and rest of the world

**_Approaches to measurement of National income_**
**(i) Expenditure Approach -** _Using Total Expenditure for Calculating National Income_
The expenditure approach canters on the components of _final demand_ which generate production.
It thus measures GDP as the total sum of expenditure on _final goods and services_ produced in an
economy. It includes:
 All consumers’ expenditure on goods and services, except for the purchase of new houses
which is included in gross _fixed capital formulation._
 All general _government final consumption_. This includes all current expenditure by _central
and local_ government on goods and services, including wages and salaries of government
employees.
 To these we add _gross fixed capital formation or expenditure on fixed assets_ (buildings,
machinery, vehicles etc) either for replacing or adding to the stock of existing fixed assets.
This is the major part of the investment which takes place in the economy.
 In addition we add the _value of physical increases in the stocks, or inventories,_ during the
course of the year.

The total of all this gives us _Total domestic expenditure_ (TDE).

We then add expenditure on exports to the TDE and arrive at a measure known as Total Final
Expenditure. It is so called because it represents the total of all spending on final goods. However,
much of the final expenditure is on imported goods and we therefore subtract spending on imports.
Having done this we arrive at a measure known as gross domestic product at market prices. To
gross domestic product at market price we subtract the taxes on expenditure levied by the
government and add on the amount of subsidy. When this has been done we arrive at a figure
known as Gross Domestic Product at factor cost.

National Income however is affected by rent, profit interest and dividends paid to, or received from,
overseas. This is added to GDP as net property income from abroad. This figure may be either
positive or negative. When this has been taken into account we arrive at the gross national product
at factor cost. As production takes place, the capital stock of a country wears out. Part of the gross
fixed capital formation is therefore, to replace worn out capital and is referred to as Capital
Consumption. When this has been subtracted we arrive at a figure known as the net national
product. Thus, summarizing the above, we can say:

```
Y = C + I + G + (X – M)
```

**(ii) Income Approach**
A second method is to _sum up all the incomes_ to individuals in the form of _wages, rents, interests and
profits_ to get domestic incomes. This is because each time something is produced and sold someone
obtains income from producing it. It follows that if we add up all incomes we should get the value of
total expenditure, or output. Incomes earned for purposes other than rewards for producing goods
and services are ignored. Such incomes are _gifts, unemployment or relief benefits, lottery, pensions,
and grants_ for students etc. These payments are known as _transfer income (payments)_ and including
them will lead to _double counting._ The test for inclusion in the national income calculation is

therefore that there should be a **“** _quid pro quo”_ that the money should have been paid against the
exchange of a good or service. Alternatively, we can say that there should be a **“** _real”_ flow in the
opposite direction to the money flow. We must also include income obtained from _subsistence
output._ This is the opposite case from transfer payments since there is a flow of real goods and
services, but no corresponding money flow. It becomes necessary to “impute’’ values for the income
that would have been received. Similarly workers may, in addition to cash income, receive _income
in kind;_ if employees are provided with _rent free housing,_ the rent which they would have to pay for
those houses on the open market should, in principle, be “imputed” as part of their income from
employment. The sum of these incomes gives _gross domestic product GDP_. This includes incomes
earned by foreigners at home and excludes incomes earned by nationals abroad. Thus, to _Gross
Domestic Income_ we add _Net property Income_ from abroad. This gives _Gross National Income_**.** From
this we deduct _depreciation_ to give _Net National Income._

**(iii) Product or Output Approach**
A final method which is more direct is the _“output method”_ or the _value added approach._ This
involves adding up the total contributions made by the various sectors of the economy. “Value
Added” is the _value added by each industry to the raw materials or processed products that it has
bought from other industries before passing on the product to the next stage in the production process._
This approach therefore centers on _final products._ Final products will include _capital goods_ as well
as _consumer goods_ since while _intermediate goods_ are used up during the period in producing other
goods; capital goods are not used up (apart from “wear and tear” or depreciation) during the period
and may be thought of as consumer goods _“stored up”_ for future periods. Final output will include
_“subsistence output”,_ which is simply _the output produced and consumed by households themselves._
Because subsistence output is not sold in the market, some assumption has to be made to value
them at some price. We also take into account the _final output of government,_ which provides
services such as education, medical care and general administrative services. However, since state
education and other governmental services are not sold on the market we shall not have market
prices at which to value them. The only obvious means of doing this is to value public services at
what it costs the government to supply them that is, by the _wages bill spent on teachers, doctors, and
the like_**.** When calculating the GDP in this matter it is necessary to avoid _double counting_

**_Difficulties in measuring National income_**

1. _Incomplete Information_ - The sources from which information is obtained are not designed
   specifically to enable national income to be calculated. Income tax returns are likely to err
   on the side of understatement. There are also some incomes that have to be estimated. Also,
   some income is not recorded; as for example when a joiner, electrician or plumber does a
   job in his spare time for a friend or neighbor. Also information on foreign payments or
   receipts may not all be recorded.
2. _Danger of double counting_ - The problem of double counting arises because of the inter-
   relationships between industries and sectors. Thus we find that the output of one sector is
   the input of another. If the values of the outputs of all the sectors were added, some would
   be added more than once, giving an erroneously large figure of national income. This may
   be avoided either by only including the value of the final product or alternatively by
   summing the values added at each stage which will give the same result. Some incomes such
   as social security benefits are received without any corresponding contribution to
   production. These are _transfer payments_ from the taxpayer to the recipient and are not
   included. _Taxes_ and _subsidies_ on goods will distort the true value of goods. To give the
   correct figure, the former should not be counted as an increase in national income for it
   does not represent any growth in real output.

3) _Unpaid services_ - Services that people do for themselves and others that are not paid for are
   usually excluded from national income accounting
4) _Depreciation_ - Replacement costs for worn out parts may not be considered
5) _Inventory valuation_ - there are many methods that can be used and each may give different
   results.
6) _Changes in the value of money_ - changes in the market prices (value) of final products due to
   inflation may result into changes in the measure of national income even if real output may
   not have changed.

**_Factors determining size of an economy’s National Income_**
The size of a nation’s income depends upon the quantity and quality of the factor endowments at its
disposal. A nation will be rich if its endowments of natural resources are large, its people are
skilled, and it has a useful accumulation of capital assets. The following points are of interest:

```
a) Natural Resources
These include the minerals of the earth; the timber, shrubs and pasturage available; the
agricultural potential (fertile soil, regular rainfall, temperature or tropical climate); the fauna
and flora; the fish; crustacea etc of the rivers and sea; the energy resources, including oil, gas,
hydro-electric, geothermal, wind and wave power.
```

```
b) Human Resources
A country is likely to prosper if it has a large population; literate and numerate sophisticated
and knowledgeable about wealth creating processes. It should be well educated and skilled,
with a nice mixture of theory and practice. It should show enterprise, being inventive, energetic
and determined in the pursuit of a better standard of living.
```

```
c) Capital Resources
A nation must create and then conserve capital resources. This includes not only tools, plant
and machinery, factories, mines, domestic dwellings, schools, colleges, etc, but a widespread
infrastructure of roads, railways, airports and ports. Transport creates the utility of space. It
makes remote resources accessible and high-cost goods into low-cost goods by opening up
remote areas and bringing them into production.
```

```
d) Self-sufficiency
A nation cannot enjoy a large national income if its citizens are not mainly self-supporting. If
the majority of the enterprises are foreign –owned there will be a withdrawal of wealth in the
form of profits or goods transferred to the investing nation.
```

```
e) Political Stability
```

**_Uses of National income accounting_**
 We need national income statistics to measure the size of the "National cake' of goods
and services available for competing uses of private consumers, government, capital
formation and exports (less imports).
 National Income statistics are also used in comparing the standard of living of a country
over time
 And also the standards of living between countries.
 National Income Statistics provide information on the stability of performance of the
economy over time e.g. a steadily increasing income would be indicative of increasing
national income.

```
 If National Income Statistics are disaggregated it would enable us to assess the relative
importance of the various sectors in the economy. This is done by considering the
contribution of the various sectors to Gross National Product over time. Such
information is crucial for planning purposes for it reveals to planners where constraints
to economic development lie. It therefore becomes possible to design a development
strategy that eventually would overcome these problems. This central contribution
could be in the form of employment or the production of goods and services.
 By assessing exports and imports as a percentage of Gross national Product i.e. using
national statistics, it is possible to determine the extent to which a country depends on
external trade.
 National Income Statistics also help in estimating the saving potential and hence
investment potential of a country.
```

**ASSIGNMENT: To what extent does national income measure social welfare?**

### 3. CONSUMPTION, SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS

### AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY

### AGGREGATE DEMAND

Aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for final goods and services in the economy at a given
time and price level. It is the amount of goods and services in the economy that will be purchased at
all possible price levels. This is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country when
inventory levels are static. It is often called demand. The aggregate demand curve is downward
sloping because at lower price levels a greater quantity is demanded.

**_Components of Aggregate Demand_**
An aggregate demand curve is the sum of individual demand curves for different sectors of the
economy. The aggregate demand is usually described as a linear sum of four separable demand
sources which are:

**1. Consumption**
Consumption expenditures ( **C** ) or consumption demand by households and unattached individuals;
its determination is described by the consumption function. The consumption function is

## C= α + (MPC) (Y-T) OR CY

The function shows that consumption is an increasing function of income where;
o _α_ is autonomous consumption, which is consumption expenditure that occurs when
income levels are zero. Expenditure does not vary with changes in income. Mainly
facilitated through borrowing.
o _MPC_ is the marginal propensity to consume, which is the proportion of the
disposable income which individuals desire to spend on consumption. It is the
proportion of additional income that an individual desires to consume. It can also be
described as the change in consumption arising from a unit change in income and is

## represented by 

## 

## 

## 

## 

## 

## 

## 

## 

## Y

## C

## 

o _(Y-T)_ is the disposable income.
Graphically, the consumption function is presented as follows:

**Income as a Determinant of Consumption**

Income is the major determinant of consumption. Keynesian consumption theory suggests that

## consumption is linearly dependent on income so that in the short run, C = Y.

## C

## Y

In Keynesian theory, savings is a function of income while investment is a function of interest rate

(r). In the long run, it is assumed that consumption entirely depends on income because with time

as Y becomes very large α disappears.

Diagrammatically this is shown as follows:

C = f(Y)
C

### 0 Y

_Long run consumption function_

In classical economics, savings is a function of interest rate i.e. S = f (r). It is assumed that depending

on the interest rate in commercial banks, households decide how much to save, before devoting the

balance to consumption i.e. C = Y – S and S = f(r). Note that in this case S is an increasing function of
interest rate hence C is a decreasing function of interest rate (r).

Whereas classical theory emphasizes consumption as a function of interest rates, Keynes’ emphasis

is on income as the main determinant of consumption. Therefore, the following inferences can be

drawn:

- Consumption is a stable function of real income
- Generally, consumption increases as income increases, but not as much as the increase
  in income
- Short run marginal propensity to consume is less than the long run marginal propensity
  to consume.
- In the long run, a greater proportion of income will be saved as real income increases
  hence the APC falls with increase in income.

**_Savings Function_**
It describes the total amount of savings at each level of disposable personal income. Savings is the

difference between disposable income and consumption. Savings function is given by:

S = Y – C

Given the consumption function, we can derive the savings function.

## Suppose C = Y, then

## S = Y - YS = -YY,

## Therefore, S = ( 1 )Y is the savings function.

The savings function is upward sloping, implying that savings is an increasing function of income.
The slope of the savings function is the marginal propensity to save (MPS). MPS is the change in

savings resulting from a unit change in personal disposable income. The average propensity to save

(APS) is the proportion of disposable personal income that is saved. It is given by S/Y, which

implies that as income increases, APS decreases and vice versa.

**_Theories of Consumption_**

**1. Absolute Income Hypothesis**
This hypothesis was postulated by Keynes.

According to this hypothesis, consumption is a function of current level of disposable personal

income. Consumption is directly, but not proportionately related to current level of aggregate

disposable income both in the short run and long run. This implies that C/Y decreases as income

increases. Keynes bases this assumption (disproportionate consumption change) on the argument

that consumers’ reaction to income change is not instant, but gradual since change in income may
not be permanent.

## Therefore, Ct = + Yt+ dCt-1.

This means that consumption over time (Ct) is not only dependent on income overtime (Yt), but also

previous level of consumption (dCt- 1 )

**2. The Relative Income Hypothesis**

This hypothesis was put forth by James Duesenberry in 1949. It makes two assumptions:

- Consumption behavior of individuals is interdependent.
- Consumption relations are irreversible over time.

**(i)** **_Consumption behavior of individuals is interdependent._**

This means that the ratio of income consumed depends on the individual’s absolute income as well

as their relative income, i.e. consumption will depend on the individual’s percentile position in the

total income distribution within a community. In any given year, an individual will consume small

percentage of his/her income if increase in his/her income is accompanied by improvement in
his/her percentile position and vice versa. If his/her percentile position remains unchanged over

time, the individual will consume the same percentage of his/her income despite changes in the

absolute income.

## S

## Y^

**(ii)** **_Consumption relations are irreversible over time._**

This assumption makes the relative income hypothesis to be referred to as previous peak theory. It

means that when income falls during cyclical downswing the resultant fall in consumption will be

less than proportionate because individuals base their consumption patterns on previous levels of

income. When income increases, consumption increases proportionately, but when income falls

below the previous peak, consumption does not fall proportionately.

```
C = f(Y) = Long run consumption function.
C 0 & C 1 = short run consumption functions.
```

If income increases from Y 0 to Y 1 , the consumer moves along the long run consumption function to

Y 1 and consumes at point B from point A. The increase in income causes the short run consumption
function to shift from C 0 to C 1. However, a decrease in income does not lead to a downward shift of

the short run consumption. This is called the **_Ratchet effect_**_._

Ratchet effect makes the consumer to move back along the short run consumption function

following a decrease in Y. When income falls back to Y 0 consumption expenditure moves along the

short run consumption function C 1 to point F from point B. F is clearly higher than A.

**3. Permanent Income Hypothesis**

It was put forward by Friedman in 1957. It states that consumption depends on permanent income.

Permanent income is defined as the present value of the expected flow of long-term income.

According to this hypothesis, permanent consumption ( _CP_ ) is proportional to permanent income

( _YP_ ), i.e. _CP = f(YP)._ The ratio of consumption _(CP_ ) to induced consumption ( _βYP_ ) is constant at all

levels of income. Income consists of two components namely: permanent income ( _YP_ ) and
transitory income ( _YT_ ). Transitory income refers to temporary unexpected rise or fall in income. It

is given by the difference between measured income (Y) and permanent income ( _Yp_ ), i.e. _Y = YP + YT._

Note that YT can be positive, negative or zero, and that the sum of transitory incomes for a group of

persons is equal to zero, i.e. ΣYT = 0. Like measured income, measured consumption (C) has two

parts, permanent consumption (CP) which is the normal or planned level of spending and it is a

## Y^

## C

## A

## B

## F

function of permanent income, and transitory consumption (CT) which is unplanned, temporary

and is a function of transitory income. Thus C _= CP + CT._

Since ΣYT = 0, then ΣCT = 0.

Therefore, we can write basic consumption function as a specific function in permanent income

given by _C = kYP,_

Where _k_ is the marginal propensity to consume

**4. Life Cycle Income Hypothesis**

This hypothesis was formulated by Modigliani, Ando and Brumberg. It is therefore also called the

MBA hypothesis. It states that consumption is a function of the expected stream of disposable

income over a long period of time and the present value of wealth. Individuals are assumed to

spread out the present value of all future income streams on consumption throughout their lifetime.
Therefore, consumption is assumed to be a function of lifetime income.

Graphically this is shown as follows:

C,S,Y

### C

### S>0,

Net saver S<0, Net dis-saver

### Y

S<0, Net borrower

0 Time (Years)

_Where C = Consumption_

_Y = Income_

_S = Savings_

According to the life cycle income hypothesis, the average propensity to consume (APC) is high in
the early and late years of an individual’s life. This is why there is non-proportionality in income

and consumption relationship in the short run. In the long run however, consumption and income

relationship will be proportional.

**_Other Determinants of Consumption_**

1. _Rate of Interest:_ According to classical economists, individuals will save more and spend less as
   interest rate increases

2) _Relative Prices:_ This influences consumption behavior with consumers shifting to relatively

```
cheaper goods.
```

3. _Capital gains:_ According to Keynes, windfall gains/losses will influence consumption. Keynes

```
argued that consumption of wealth owners can be influenced by sudden changes in the money
value of their wealth. Sudden changes are common where the stock exchange market is
composed of speculators.
```

4. _Wealth:_ High stocks of wealth lead to low marginal value of wealth and hence less desire to

```
accumulate more. As a result, this leads to increased consumption.
```

5. _Money stock (Liquid assets):_ The higher the stock of liquid assets the higher the marginal

```
propensity to consume.
```

6. _Availability of consumer credit:_ Readily available and/or cheap consumer credit leads to

```
consumers borrowing for consumption purposes. This pushes up the aggregate consumption
function.
```

7. _Attitudes and Expectations of Consumers_ : Both change in consumer attitudes and expectations

```
affect their consumption behavior. If for instance, consumers expect a price increase of a certain
good; they may increase their current purchase of the same good.
```

8. _Money Illusion_ : Consumption will go up when consumers suffer from money illusion. Money

```
illusion occurs when consumers fail to realize the price increase accompanying the increase in
their nominal income, thereby behaving as though their real income has increased when it has
not. Money illusion is also called Pigou or real cash balance effect.
```

9. _Distribution of Income_ : Redistribution of income may cause a shift in the aggregate consumption

```
function, or lead to both a shift to a change in the slope of the function. It therefore affects the
level of aggregate consumption, if the recipients have different marginal propensity to consume
and average propensity to consume.
```

10. _Composition of Population:_ Population composition in terms of age, sex and class determines

```
consumption.
```

**2. Gross Domestic Investment**
Gross private domestic investment ( **I** ), such as spending by business firms on factory construction.
This includes all private sectors spending aimed at the production of some future consumable.
Investment refers to the addition of capital stock in an economy. Therefore, it is given by the value

of that part of aggregate output for any given year that takes the form of:

- Construction of new structures
- Changes in business inventories
- New capital investment

**Types of Investment**

1. _Autonomous Investment_ (I 0 ): This is investment that does not depend on the level of income. It is
   determined by exogenous functions e.g. inventories, population growth, wealth changes,
   research, etc.
2. _Induced Investment_ : This is investment that depends on income or profit. It is influenced by the

```
factors, which affect income and profit e.g. prices, wages, interest, etc.
```

Induced investment is a function of income and is given by the equation

## I = I 0 + Y,

## Where Y = Induced Investment

## = Marginal propensity to invest (MPI)

```
I 0 = Autonomous Investment
MPI is the change in investment due to a unit change in income i.e. ΔI/ΔY, while API is
the ratio of investment to income i.e. I/Y.
```

_3. Gross and Net Investment:_

```
Gross investment is the total increase in capital stock in a year.
Net investment is the net addition to capital stock in an economy after deducting capital
consumption allowance from gross investment.
```

_4. Intended and Unintended Investment_

```
Intended (voluntary/planned) investment refers to deliberate accumulation of capital stock
aimed at achieving a specific objective.
Unintended (Involuntary/unplanned) investment is where capital stock accumulated due to
unexpected fall in demand.
```

**Determinants of Investment**

1. _Interest rate (i):_ Investment is inversely related to interest rate.
2. _Internal rate of Return (IRR):_ It is the rate of interest that equates the present value of benefits

```
from a project to the present value of its costs. A decision to invest is based on the comparison
between IRR and i.
```

If IRR > i, investment is made
IRR < i, no investment

IRR = i, other factors are considered in deciding whether or not to invest.

3. _Expected future income flows_ ;- if the investor expects high profits, then investment will be

```
undertaken and vice versa
```

4. _Initial cost of the capital good and its useful life_ : - if the capital good is affordable then it will be

```
purchased and vice versa. An investor will purchase a good that is likely to last longer
```

5. _Degree of certainty_ : An investor considers the risks and uncertainties involved in a particular
   investment. if they are high he may not invest
   _6. Existing stock of capital:_ If the existing capital is large potential investors may be discouraged.

```
Similarly if there is excess or idle capacity in existing capital stock, investment may be
discouraged.
```

7. _Level of income;_ a rise in the level of income in the economy due to rise in money wages and
   other factors prices raises the demand for goods and services and this in turn will induce an
   increase in investment
8. _Business expectations_ ; if businessmen are optimistic and confident regarding future returns

```
from capital goods they invest more.
```

9. _Consumer demand_ ; If the current demand for consumer goods is increasing rapidly, more

```
investments will be made
```

10. _Liquid assets_ ; If investors possess large liquid assets then their inducements to invest is high
11. _Invention and innovation_ : If investments and technological improvements lead to more efficient

```
methods of production, which reduce costs, the marginal efficiency of new capital assets will
rise, hence firms will invest more.
```

12. _New products_ ; if sale prospects of the new product is high and the expected revenue more than

```
costs, investment will be encouraged
```

13. _Population growth;_ this implies that there is a growing market (demand) for goods and services

```
that must be met by increased production hence investment will increase to provide the capital
goods required to increase production..
```

14. _Government policy:_ Government can encourage investment through reduction in taxes and
    provision of social amenities for those investing in particular sectors.
    _15. Political climate and stability;_ if there is political instability in the economy, investment will

```
adversely be affected.
```

**3. Government Expenditures**
Gross government investment and consumption expenditures ( **G** )
**4. Net Exports**
Net exports ( **X-M** )), i.e., net demand by the rest of the world for the country's output.

In sum, for a single country at a given time, aggregate demand

```
AD = C + Ip + G + (X-M).
```

**_Aggregate demand curves_**
Understanding of the aggregate demand curve depends on whether it is examined based on
changes in demand as income changes, or as price change. Sometimes, aggregate demand refers to
an entire demand curve that _looks_ like that in a typical aggregate supply and aggregate demand
diagram.

Typically, the aggregate quantity demanded ( **Yd)** rises as the average price level ( **P** ) falls, as with
the **AD** line in the diagram. The main theoretical reason for this is that if the nominal money supply
( **Ms** ) is constant, a falling **P** implies that the real money supply ( **Ms** / **P** )rises, encouraging lower
interest rates and higher spending. This is often called the "Keynes effect."

Carefully using ideas from the theory of supply and demand, aggregate supply can help determine
the extent to which increases in aggregate demand lead to increases in real output or instead to
increases in prices (inflation). In the diagram, an increase in any of the components of **AD** (at any
given **P** ) shifts the **AD** curve to the right. This increases both the level of real production ( **Y** ) and the
average price level ( **P** ).

But different levels of economic activity imply different mixtures of output and price increases.
With very low levels of real gross domestic product and thus large amounts of unemployed
resources, most economists of the Keynesian school suggest that most of the change would be in the
form of output and employment increases. As the economy gets close to potential output ( **Y\*** ) or full
employment level, we would see more and more price increases rather than output increases as **AD**
increases.

Beyond **Y\*** , this gets more intense, so that price increases dominate. Worse, output levels greater
than **Y\*** cannot be sustained for long. The **AS** is a _short-term_ relationship here. If the economy
persists in operating above potential, the **AS** curve will shift to the left, making the increases in real
output transitory.

At low levels of **Y** , the world is more complicated. First, most modern industrial economies
experience few if any falls in prices. So the **AS** curve is unlikely to shift down or to the right. Second,
when they do suffer price cuts (as in Japan), it can lead to disastrous deflation.

**_Factors that can shift an aggregate demand curve include:_**

```
 Real Interest Rate Changes - Such changes will impact capital goods decisions made by
individual consumers and by businesses. Lower real interest rates will lower the costs of
major products such as cars, large appliances and houses; they will increase business capital
project spending because long-term costs of investment projects are reduced. The aggregate
demand curve will shift down and to the right. Higher real interest rates will make capital
goods relatively more expensive and cause the aggregate demand curve to shift up and to
the left.
 Changes in Expectations - If businesses and households are more optimistic about the
future of the economy, they are more likely to buy large items and make new investments;
this will increase aggregate demand.
 The Wealth Effect - If real household wealth increases (decreases), then aggregate demand
will increase (decrease)
 Changes in Income of Foreigners - If the income of foreigners increases (decreases), then
aggregate demand for domestically-produced goods and services should increase
(decrease).
 Changes in Currency Exchange Rates - From the viewpoint of the U.S., if the value of the
U.S. dollar falls (rises), foreign goods will become more (less) expensive, while goods
produced in the U.S. will become cheaper (more expensive) to foreigners. The net result will
be an increase (decrease) in aggregate demand.
 Inflation Expectation Changes - If consumers expect inflation to go up in the future, they
will tend to buy now causing aggregate demand to increase. If consumers' expectations shift
so that they expect prices to decline in the future, t aggregate demand will decline and the
aggregate demand curve will shift up and to the left.
```

### AGGREGATE SUPPLY

The **aggregate supply curve** depicts the quantity of real GDP that is supplied by the economy at
different price levels. The reasoning used to construct the aggregate supply curve differs from the
reasoning used to construct the supply curves for individual goods and services. The supply curve
for an individual good is drawn under the assumption that input prices remain constant. As the
price of good X rises, sellers' per unit costs of providing good X do not change, and so sellers are
willing to supply more of good X‐hence, the upward slope of the supply curve for good X. The
aggregate supply curve, however, is defined in terms of the _price level_. Increases in the price level
will increase the price that producers can get for their products and thus induce more output. But
an increase in the price will also have a second effect; it will eventually lead to increases in input
prices as well, which, _ceteris paribus_ , will cause producers to cut back. So, there is some uncertainty
as to whether the economy will supply more real GDP as the price level rises. In order to address
this issue, it has become customary to distinguish between two types of aggregate supply curves,
the **short‐run aggregate supply curve** and the **long‐run aggregate supply curve**.

**_Short‐run aggregate supply curve_**

The **short‐run aggregate supply (SAS) curve** is considered a valid description of the supply

schedule of the economy _only_ in the short‐run. The **short‐run** is the period that begins immediately

after an increase in the price level and that ends when _input prices_ have increased in the _same
proportion_ to the increase in the price level.

Input prices are the prices paid to the providers of input goods and services. These input prices

include the wages paid to workers, the interest paid to the providers of capital, the rent paid to

landowners, and the prices paid to suppliers of intermediate goods. When the price level of final

goods rises, the cost of living increases for those who provide input goods and services. Once these

input providers realize that the cost of living has increased, they will increase the prices that they
charge for their input goods and services in proportion to the increase in the price level for final

goods.

The presumption underlying the SAS curve is that input providers _do not_ or _cannot_ take account of

the increase in the general price level right away so that it takes some time–referred to as the short‐

run–for input prices to fully reflect changes in the price level for final goods. For example, workers

often negotiate multi‐year contracts with their employers. These contracts usually include a certain
allowance for an increase in the price level, called a **cost of living adjustment (COLA)**. The COLA,

however, is based on expectations of the future price level that may turn out to be wrong. Suppose,

for example, that workers _underestimate_ the increase in the price level that occurs during the multi‐

year contract. Depending on the terms of the contract, the workers may not have the opportunity to

correct their mistaken estimates of inflation until the contract expires. In this case, their wage

increases will lag behind the increases in the price level for some time.

During the short‐run, _sellers of final goods_ are receiving higher prices for their products, without a

proportional increase in the cost of their inputs. The higher the price level, the more these sellers

will be willing to supply. The _SAS_ curve—depicted in Figure (a)—is therefore upward sloping,

reflecting the positive relationship that exists between the price level and the quantity of goods

supplied in the short‐run

## Long‐run aggregate supply curve

**The long‐run aggregate supply (LAS) curve** describes the economy's supply schedule in the long‐

run. The **long‐run** is defined as the period when input prices have completely adjusted to changes
in the price level of final goods. In the long‐run, the increase in prices that sellers receive for their

final goods is completely offset by the proportional increase in the prices that sellers pay for inputs.

The result is that the quantity of real GDP supplied by all sellers in the economy is independent of

changes in the price level. The LAS curve—depicted in Figure (b)—is a vertical line, reflecting the

fact that long‐run aggregate supply is not affected by changes in the price level. Note that the _LAS_

curve is vertical at the point labeled as the **natural level of real GDP**. The natural level of real GDP

is defined as the level of real GDP that arises when the economy is _fully employing all_ of its available
input resources.

**_Money_**

**_The nature and function of money_**
The development of money was necessitated by specialization and exchange. Money was needed to
overcome the shortcomings and frustrations of the barter system which is system where goods and
services are exchanged for other goods and services.

**_Disadvantages of Barter Trade_**
 It is impossible to barter unless A has what B wants, and A wants what B has. This is called
double _coincidence_ of wants and is difficult to fulfill in practice.
 Even when each party wants what the other has, it does not follow they can agree on a fair
exchange. A good deal of time can be wasted sorting out equations of value.
 The indivisibility of large items is another problem. For instance if a cow is worth two
sacks of wheat, what is one sack of wheat worth? Once again we may need to carry over
part of the transaction to a later period of time.
 It is possible to confuse the _use value_ and _exchange value_ of goods and services in a barter
economy. Such confusion precludes a rational allocation of resources and promotion of
economic efficiency.
 When exchange takes place over time in an economy, it is necessary to store goods for
future exchange. If such goods are perishable by nature, then the system will break down.
 The development of industrial economies usually depends on a division of labour,
specialization and allocation of resources on the basis of choices and preferences.
Economic efficiency is achieved by economizing on the use of the most scarce resources.
Without a common medium of exchange and a common unit of account which is acceptable
to both consumers and producers, it is very difficult to achieve an efficient allocation of
resources to satisfy consumer preferences.

For these reasons the barter system is discarded by societies which develop beyond _autarky_ to
more specialized methods of production. For such peoples a money system is essential. Money may
be defined as anything generally acceptable in the settlement of debts.

**_The Historical development of money_**
For the early forms of money, the intrinsic value of the commodities provided the basis for general
_acceptability:_ For instance, corn, salt, tobacco, or cloth was widely used because they had obvious
value themselves. These could be regarded as _commodity money_**.** Commodity money had uses other
than as a medium of exchange (e.g. salt could be used to preserve meat, as well as in exchange). But
money commodities were not particularly convenient to use as money. Some were difficult to

_transport,_ some _deteriorated overtime_ , some _could not be easily divided and some were valued
differently by different cultures._

As the trade developed between different cultures, many chose _precious metal’s_ mainly gold or
silver as their commodity money. These had the advantage of being _easily recognizable, portable,
indestructible and scarce_ (which meant it preserved its value over time). The value of the metal was
in terms of weight. Thus each time a transaction was made, the metal was weighed and payment
made. Due to the inconvenience of weighing each time a transaction was made, this led to the
development of coin money. The state took over the _minting_ of coins by stamping each as being a
particular weight and purity (e.g. one pound of silver). They were later given a rough edge so that
people could guard against being cheated by an unscrupulous trade filling the edge down.

It became readily apparent, however, that what was important was public confidence in the
“currency” of money, its ability to run from hand to hand and circulate freely, rather than its
intrinsic value. As a result there was deliberately reduced below the face value of the coinage. Any
person receiving such a coin could afford not to mind, so long as he was confident that anyone to
whom he passed on the coin would also “ _not mind”._ Debasement represents an early form of
fiduciary issue, i.e. issuing of money dependent on the “faith of the public” and was resorted to
because it permitted the extension of the supply of money beyond the availability of gold and silver.

**_Paper Money_**
Due to the risk of theft, members of the public who owned such metal money would deposit them
for safe keeping with _goldsmiths_ and other _reliable merchants_ who would issue a receipt to the
depositor. The metal could not be withdrawn without production of the receipt signed by the
depositor. Each time a transaction was made, the required amount of the metal would be
withdrawn and payment made.

It was later discovered that as long as the person being paid was convinced the person paying had
gold and the reputation of the goldsmith was sufficient to ensure acceptability of his promise to
pay, it became convenient for the depositor to pass on the goldsmith’s receipt and the person being
paid will withdraw the gold himself. Initially, the gold would be withdrawn immediately after the
transaction was made. But eventually it was discovered that so long as each time a transaction was
made the person being paid was convinced that there was gold, the signed receipt could change
hands more than once. Eventually, the receipts were made payable to the bearer (rather than the
depositor) and started to circulate as a means of payment themselves, without the coins having to
leave the vaults. This led to the development of _paper money,_ which had the added advantage of
lightness.

Initially, paper money was backed by precious metal and convertible into precious metal on
demand. However, the goldsmiths or early bankers discovered that not all the gold they held was
claimed at the same time and that more gold kept on coming in (gold later became the only
accepted form of money). Consequently they started to issue more bank notes than they had gold to
back them, and the extra money created was lent out as loans on which interest was charged. This

became lucrative business, so much so that in the 18

```
th
and 19
```

th
centuries there was a bank crisis in
England when the banks failed to honor their obligations to their depositors, i.e. there were more
demands than there was gold to meet them. This caused the government to intervene into the
banking system so as to restore confidence. Initially each bank was allowed to issue its own
currency and to issue more currency than it had gold to back it. This is called _fractional backing,_ but
the Bank of England put restrictions on how much money could be issued.

Eventually, the role of issuing currency was completely taken over by the Central Bank for effective
control. Initially, the money issued by the Central Bank was backed by gold (fractionally), i.e. the
holder had the right to claim gold from the Central Bank. However, since money is essentially
needed for purchase of goods and services, present day money is not backed by gold, but it is based
on the level of production, the higher the output, the higher is the money supply. Thus, present day
money is called _token money_ i.e. money backed by the level of output.

Over time, therefore, it became clear that for an item to act as money it must possess the following
characteristics

1. _Acceptability_ If money is to be used as medium of exchange for goods and services, then it
   must be generally accepted as having value in exchange. This was true of metallic money in
   the past because it was in high and stable demand for its ornamental value. It is true of
   paper money, due to the good name of the note-issuing authority.
2. _Portability_ If an item is to be used as money, it must be easily portable, so that it is a
   convenient means of exchange.
3. _Scarcity_ If money is to be used in exchange for scarce goods and services, then it is
   important that money is in scarce supply. For an item to be acceptable as money, it must be
   scarce.
4. _Divisibility_ It is essential that any asset which is used as money is divisible into small units,
   so that _Durability_ Money has to pass
   through many different hands during its working life. Precious metals became popular
   because they do not deteriorate rapidly in use. Any asset which is to be used as money must
   be durable. It must not depreciate over time so that it can be used as a store of wealth.
5. _Durability_ Money has to pass through many different hands during its working life. Precious
   metals became popular because they do not deteriorate rapidly in use. Any asset which is to
   be used as money must be durable. It must not depreciate over time so that it can be used as
   a store of wealth.
6. _Homogeneity_ It is desirable that money should be as uniform as possible.

**_Functions of money_**

1. **_Medium of exchange:_** Money facilitates the exchange of goods and services in the economy.
   Workers accept money for their wages because they know that money can be exchanged for
   all the different things they will need. Use of money as an intermediary in transactions
   therefore, removes the requirement for double coincidence of wants between transactions.
   Without money, the world’s complicated economic systems which are based on
   specialization and the division of labor would be impossible. The use of money enables a
   person who receives payment for services in money to obtain an exchange for it, the
   assortment of goods and services from the particular amount of expenditure which will give
   maximum satisfaction.
2. **_Unit of account:_** Money is a means by which the prices of goods and services are quoted
   and accounts kept. The use of money for accounting purposes makes possible the operation
   of the price system and automatically provides the basis for keeping accounts, calculating
   profit and loss, costing etc. It facilitates the evaluation of performance and forward

```
planning. It also allows for the comparison of the relative values of goods and services even
without an intention of actually spending (money) on them e.g. “window shopping”.
```

3. **_Store of Wealth/value:_** The use of money makes it possible to separate the act of sale from
   the act of purchase. Money is the most convenient way of keeping any form of property
   which is surplus to immediate use; thus in particular, money is a store of value of which all
   assets/property can be converted. By refraining from spending a portion of one’s current
   income for some time, it becomes possible to set up a large sum of money to spend later (of
   course subject to the time value of money). Less durable or otherwise perishable goods tend
   to depreciate considerably over time, and owners of such goods avoid loss by converting
   them into money.
4. **_Standard of deferred payment:_** Many transactions involve future payment, e.g. hire
   purchase, mortgages, long term construction works and bank credit facilities. Money thus
   provides the unit in which, given the stability in its value, loans are advanced/made and
   future contracts fixed. Borrowers never want money for its own sake, but only for the
   command it gives over real resources. The use of money again allows a firm to borrow for
   the payment of wages, purchase of raw materials or generally to offset outstanding debt
   obligations; with money borrowing and lending become much easier, convenient and
   satisfying. It’s about making commerce and industry more viable.

```
Only money, of all possible assets, can be converted into other goods immediately and without
cost.
```

**_Financial Institutions_**

Are organizations legally bound to deal with finances? There are three categories of these
institutions namely: -
 Commercial Banks
 Central Bank
 Non-bank financial institutions

**Commercial Banks**
A Commercial Bank is a financial institution which undertakes all kinds of ordinary banking
business like accepting deposits, advancing loans and is a member of the clearing house i.e.
operates or has a current account with the Central Bank. They are sometimes known as Joint Stock
Banks.

**_Functions of Commercial Banks_**
In modern economy, commercial banks have the following functions:
i. They provide a safe deposit for money and other valuables.
ii. They lend money to borrowers partly because they charge interest on the loans, which is a
source of income for them, and partly because they usually lend to commercial enterprises
and help in bringing about development.
iii. They provide safe and non-inflationary means for debt settlements through the use of
cheques, in that no cash is actually handled. This is particularly important where large
amounts of money are involved.
iv. They act as agents of the central banks in dealings involving foreign exchange on behalf of
the central bank and issue travelers’ cheques on instructions from the central bank.
v. They offer management advisory services especially to enterprises which borrow from
them to ensure that their loans are properly utilized.

```
vi. Some commercial banks offer insurance services to their customers e.g. The Standard Bank
(Kenya) which offers insurance services to those who hold savings accounts with it.
vii. Some commercial banks issue local travelers’ cheques, e.g. the Barclays Bank (Kenya). This
is useful in that it guards against loss and theft for if the cheques are lost or stolen; the lost
or stolen numbers can be cancelled, which cannot easily be done with cash. This also safe if
large amount of money is involved.
```

**_Bank Deposit_**

Bank notes and coins together constitute the currency in circulation. But they form only a part of
the total money supply. The larger part of the money supply in circulation today consists of bank
deposits. Bank deposits can either be a current account or deposit account. These are created by
commercial banks and the process is called credit creation.

**_Credit Creation_**

The ability of banks to create deposit money depends on the fact that bank deposits need to be only
fractionally backed by notes and coins. Because the bank does not need to keep 100 per cent
reserves, it can use some of the money deposited to purchase income-yielding investments

**The Central Bank**

A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages
a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also usually oversee
the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a
central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state, and usually also
prints the national currency which usually serves as the state's legal tender.

The functions of the central bank are;
i. Government’s banker: Government’s need to hold their funds in an account into which they
can make deposits and against which they can draw cheques. Such accounts are usually held
by the Central Bank
ii. Banker’s Bank: Commercial banks need a place to deposit their funds; they need to be able
to transfer their funds among themselves; and they need to be able to borrow money when
they are short of cash. The Central Bank accepts deposits from the commercial banks and
will on order transfer these deposits among the commercial banks. Consider any two banks
A and B. On any given day, there will be cheques drawn on A for B and on B for A. If the
person paying and the person are being paid bank with the same bank, there will be a
transfer of money from the account or deposit of the payee. If the two people do not bank
with the same bank, such cheques end up in the central bank. In such cases, they cancel each
other out. But if there is an outstanding balance, say in favor of A, then A’s deposit with the
central bank will go up, and B’s deposit will go down. Thus the central bank acts as the
Clearing House of commercial banks.
iii. Issue of notes and coins: In most countries the central bank has the sole power to issue and
control notes and coins. This is a function it took over from the commercial banks for
effective control and to ensure maintenance of confidence in the banking system.
iv. Lender of last resort: Commercial banks often have sudden needs for cash and one way of
getting it is to borrow from the central bank. If all other sources failed, the central bank

```
would lend money to commercial banks with good investments but in temporary need of
cash. To discourage banks from over-lending, the central bank will normally lend to the
commercial banks at a high rate of interest which the commercial bank passes on to the
borrowers at an even higher rate. For this reason, commercial banks borrow from the
central bank as the lender of the last resort.
v. Managing national debt: It is responsible for the sale of Government Securities or Treasury
Bills, the payment of interests on them and their redeeming when they mature.
vi. Banking supervision: In liberalized economy, central banks usually have a major role to play
in policing the economy.
vii. Operating monetary policy: Monetary policy is the regulation of the economy through the
control of the quantity of money available and through the price of money i.e. the rate of
interest borrowers will have to pay. Expanding the quantity of money and lowering the rate
of interest should stimulate spending in the economy and is thus expansionary, or
inflationary. Conversely, restricting the quantity of money and raising the rate of interest
should have a restraining, or deflationary effect upon the economy.
```

**_Tools/Instruments of monetary policy_**

**_a) Open Market Operations_**
The Central Bank holds government securities. It can sell some of these, or buy more, on the open
market, buying or selling through a stock exchange or money market. When the bank sells
securities to be bought by members of the public, the buyers will pay by writing cheques on their
accounts with commercial banks. This means a cash drain for these banks to the central bank,
represented by a fall in the item “bankers” deposits’ at the central bank, which forms part of the
commercial banks’ reserve assets. Since the banks maintain a fixed liquidity (or cash) ratio, the loss
of these reserves will bring about multiple contractions of bank loans and deposits.

By going into the market as a buyer of securities, the central bank can reverse the process,
increasing the liquidity of commercial banks, causing them to expand bank credit, always assuming
a ready supply of credit-worthy borrowers. Conversely, if the central bank wanted to pursue an
expansionary monetary policy by making more credit available to the public, it would buy bonds
from the public. It would pay sellers by cheques drawn on it; the sellers would then deposit these
with commercial banks, who would deposit them again with the central bank. This increase in cash
and reserve assets would permit them to carry out a multiple expansion of bank deposits,
increasing advances and the money supply together.

**_b) Discount Rate (Bank Rate)_**
This is the rate on central bank advances and is also called official discount rate or “minimum
lending rate”. When commercial banks find themselves short of cash they may, instead of
contracting bank deposits, go to the central bank, which can make additional cash available in its
capacity as “lender of last resort”, to help the banks out of their difficulties. The Central Bank can
make cash available on a short-term basis in either of two ways; by lending cash directly, charging a
rate of interest which is referred to as the official “discount rate”, or by buying approved short-term
securities from the commercial banks. The central bank exercises regulatory powers as a lender of
last resort by making this help both more expensive to get and more difficult to get. It can do the
former by charging a very high “penal” rate of interest, well above other short-term rates ruling in
the money market. Similarly, when it makes cash available by buying approved short-term
securities, it can charge a high effective rate of interest by buying them at low prices. The effective

rate of interest charged when central bank buys securities (supplying cash) is in fact a re-discount
rate, since the bank is buying securities which are already on the market but at a discount.

The significance of this rate of interest charged by the central bank in one way or the other to
commercial banks, as a lender of last resort, is that if this rate goes up the commercial banks, who
find that their costs of borrowing have increased, are likely to raise the rates of interest on their
lending to businessman and other borrowers. Other interest rates such as those charged by
building societies on house mortgages are then also likely to be pulled up.

**_c) Special Deposit_**
If the Central Bank feels that there is too much money in circulation, it can in addition require
commercial banks to maintain over and above cash or liquid assets some additional reserves in the
form of Special Deposits. The commercial banks are asked to maintain additional deposits in their
accounts at the central bank, deposits which cease to count among their reserve assets as cover for
their liabilities.

**_d) Direct control_**
Without actually using the above weapons, the central bank can attempt simply to use “moral
suasion” to persuade the commercial banks to restrict credit when they wish to limit monetary
expansion. Its effectiveness depends on the co-operation of the commercial banks.

**_e) General and Selective Credit Control_**
These are imposed with the full apparatus of the law or informally using specific instructions to
banks and other institutions. For instance, the central bank can dictate a ceiling value to the amount
of deposits the bank can create. This is more effective in controlling bank lending than the cash and
liquidity ratio. It can also encourage banks to lend more to a certain sector of the economy (e.g.
agriculture) than in another (estate building). Selective controls are especially useful in less
developed investment away from less important sectors such as the construction of buildings, the
commercial sector, or speculative purchase of land, towards more important areas.

**_Keynesian Theory of Demand for Money_**

According to Keynes there are three distinctive motives for holding money.
(i) Transactions motive
(ii) Speculative Motive
(iii) Precautionary Motive
An individual’s aggregate demand for money is based on a decision that takes the three motives
into account.

**(i) Transactions Demand for Money**
This is the amount of money that households, firms and the government hold, for future exchange
of goods and services. These agencies hold money because income (money receipts) and
expenditure flows are not synchronized in time. Expenditure tends to be continuous while receipts
are discrete. Money is therefore required to bridge the gap between receipts and disbursements.
The amount of money held for transaction purposes depend on:
 Level of income
 Spending habits
 Time interval in-between income receipts

Money is held at an opportunity cost of the interest it would earn if it were invested. Holding
spending habits and interval between income receipts constant, the higher the income, the higher
the amount of money held for transaction motive.

**(ii) Precautionary Demand for Money**

This is the amount of money held to provide for unexpected expenditures. According to Keynes
precautionary demand is determined by an individual’s income and institutional factors, which he
considered fixed in the short run, so that;

Mt = kY,
Where Mt is combined transaction and precautionary demand for real cash balances.

Unlike in the classical quantity theory where the world is assumed to be perfect with all receipts
and expenditures known, in the Keynesian model, there exists uncertainty, hence need for
precautionary money balances. The precautionary motive arises from the need to provide for the
contingencies that require sudden expenditure and for unforeseen opportunities. Just like the
transaction motive, precautionary demand for money is interest inelastic.

**(iii) Speculation Demand for Money**

It refers to the amount of money held to take advantage of profitable opportunities that may arise
in financial markets. Whereas the transactions and precautionary motives of demand for money
look at money as a medium of exchange, the speculative motive looks at it as store of value. People
hold money for speculation purposes due to uncertainty about the future rate of interest. A fall in
the interest rate leads to an increase in the speculation demand for money.

**The Modern Quantity Theory of Money**
It was put forward by Friedman. According to this theory, money is just one of the many ways in
which wealth can be held. The other ways include consumer durables, all kinds of financial assets,
property and human wealth. This theory postulates that money has a convenience yield in the sense
that holding it saves time and effort in carrying out transactions. In this model, the equation for
demand for money is given as:

### P

```
Md
= f(W, r, w, T)
```

Where P

```
Md
```

= real demand for money;
W = total wealth;
r = expected rate of return on various forms of wealth;
w = ratio of human wealth to non-human wealth; and
T = Society’s tastes and preferences.

Demand for money is directly related with total wealth as long as wealth holders regard money as a
normal good. Since rates of return on bonds and equities represent the opportunity cost of holding
money, demand for money is inversely related to the expected rates of return on wealth.

The higher the ratio of human to non-human wealth the greater will be the demand for money in
order to compensate for limited the limited marketability of human wealth. Demand for money also
depends on various factors that influence wealth holders’ tastes and preferences for money.

Friedman defines income in this model as measured by permanent income. He also assumes that W
& T are constant in the short run. Therefore, the aggregate money demand becomes:

### P

Md
= f(YP, r)
This is the modern quantity theory of demand for money equation.

**Money Supply**

Money is defined in two ways: narrowly and broadly.

The narrow definition for money includes coins, currency, demand deposits and other checkable
deposits. The total of coins, currency, bank deposits and other checkable deposits is what we call
money supply in the narrow sense. This is also called M1.

**_Coins:_**
Are a small proportion of the total quantities of money in an economy. They come in small
denominations. They are made of metal and normally the value of metal in them is less than the face
value of the coin.

**_Currency_**
This is paper money e.g. 50/= and 100/= bills. Currency constitutes the second and far larger share
of the total money supply than coins. The central bank of Kenya issues all the currency just as it
does the coins. Initially, there used to be gold of equivalent value to the amount of currency issued
to back it and give it value. Currently, however, all the money is not backed by gold. Its value is
derived from its acceptability by people.

**_Bank Deposits_**
These are bank deposits subject to payment on demand. They are much larger than coins and
currency. They are also called checking accounts. These deposits are considered to be money
because they can be as easily used in transactions as cash, by simply issuing a check. They are as
much as money in storing value, as a medium of exchange and as a standard of value.

**_Other checkable deposits_**
These include negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other accounts that are very
close to being demand deposits. NOW accounts are interest-bearing checking accounts at banks,
savings societies and other financial institutions. Money supply is broadly defined as narrow money
plus savings and small time deposits, money market mutual fund balances and money market
deposit accounts. This money supply broadly defined is also called M2.

The reason why time and savings deposits were excluded from the narrow definition of money is
that they are not readily withdrawable and so can’t perform effectively the role of being medium of
exchange. However, since they perform the other functions of money and can actually be
withdrawn and used for transaction (though not readily), they have been included in M2.

### NB

Note that there is no clear dividing line between money and non-money, since many assets have
some characteristics of money. For instance, it is easy to convert government bonds into money, but
they are not included in money because their prices fluctuate with interest rates and so they are not
a good store of value. Assets that are easy to convert into cash are called rear-money. There is
disagreement, however, among economists as to what is to be considered rear-money and what not
to be considered rear-money.

**_The concept of velocity of money_**

Velocity of circulation of money is the rate at which money stock is used to make transactions for
final goods and services.
This was put forward by Irving fisher, in his version of the quantity theory of money
Fisher summarized the quantity theory of money in the following equation:
MV ≡ PT
Where: M = nominal stock of money in the economy
V = the transactions velocity of circulation of money
P = the general price level of all transactions
T = the number of transactions that take place during the time period

Both MV and PT measure the total value of transactions during the time period hence are always
identical.
For example if we suppose that in a given economy the number of transactions (T) = 100 and the
average price (P) is 10/=, then PT = 1000/=. If the stock of money is 100/=, then the number of
times it changes hands (V) = 10.
Therefore given any three of the components of the identity MV = PT, it is possible to compute the
value of the remaining component.

**The Open Economy**
The foreign sector is captured in the analysis of equilibrium through the balance of payments
(BOP). Balance of payments is a summary statement of the monetary value of the flow of economic
transaction between citizens of one country and the rest of the world over a given period of time.

BOP is made up of:

- All exports and imports of goods and services.
- All capital loans abroad and borrowing from foreign countries.
- All movements of goods and international reserves into and out of the country.

**The BOP curve**
BP curve is the balance of payments curve and it shows various combinations of interest rates and
levels of national income that produce equilibrium in the balance of payments at a given exchange
rate

Interest
rate (r)
Surplus BP curve
BOP

Income (Y)

The BP curve is positively sloped because the higher the level of income, the smaller the net export
balance, which can only be offset by a higher interest rate, hence reducing the net capital outflow.

- All points below and to the right of the BOP curve indicate deficits in balance of payment
- All points above and to the left of the BOP curve indicate a surplus in balance of payments

**Factors that Cause Shifts in the BP Curve**

1. A change in exchange rates. An appreciation of the exchange rate will shift the BP curve to the
   left. A rise in the value of the Kenyan currency makes Kenyan goods more expensive for foreign
   buyers and foreign goods less expensive for Kenyan buyers. As a result, exports decline and
   imports increase causing the BP curve to shift to the left due to decline in net export balance,
   and vice versa.

- For this to work, the elasticities of demand for exports and imports must according to Marshall-
  Lerner, exceed one. This is only likely to happen in the long-run. In the short-run. The
  elasticities will be low leading to a worsening in the balance of payments. This is what is
  referred to as the J-curve phenomenon.
- Devaluation may also fail to achieve the goal of realizing increased exports if other countries
  retaliate.
- If devaluation succeeds in improving the trade balance, this represents an injection of funds
  into the economy, which boost the level of national income. Improved normal income leads to
  high demand for imports, which must be checked by the government employing deflationary
  measures.
- Deflationary measures are necessary especially if the element is at full employment to avoid
  demand a pull inflation that would otherwise erode the competitive advantage gained by the
  country through devaluation.
- Devaluation therefore may be an appropriated policy for a country faced with a balance of
  payments deficit, provided the possibility of induced domestic inflation, for an economy that is
  close to full employment is not overlooked.

2. A change in the ratio of domestic to foreign prices: An increase in the ratio of domestic to
   foreign prices makes Kenyan goods more expensive, holding all other factors constant. This
   leads to a reduction in net export balance (X – M), hence BP curve shifts to the left and vice
   versa.

**_Methods used to correct trade deficit_**

- Equilibrium in balance of payments implies that net inflow or outflow of foreign currency is
  zero. If the economy has a balance of payments deficit, the following measures can be instituted
  to correct it.
  (i) Borrowing from abroad
  (ii) Deplete reserves of foreign currency
  (iii) Devaluation of currency
  (iv) Direct controls

### 5. UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION

### UNEMPLOYMENT

Unemployment refers to a situation where individuals that are supposed to be used in production
are willing and able to be employed at the existing wage rates, but are unutilized or underutilized.
Unemployment rate is computed as follows

##  100

## Totalnumberof workforce

## Number unemployed

**_Types of unemployment_**

**1. Open Involuntary Unemployment**
This is where people who are not working and are able to work at the existing wage rate cannot get
jobs.
**2. Open Voluntary Unemployment** - Is where people are able to get jobs at existing wage rate but prefer not to work.
**3. Natural rate of unemployment** - This is the level of unemployment that exists when the economy is at full employment,
producing its potential output.
**4. Frictional Unemployment** - This is caused by the time lag involved in redeployment of labor. This land of unemployment
is caused by mobility problems in the labor market, which result in friction in the labor
market. This friction is either due to communication problems or mismatch between job
opportunities and job seekers.
**5. Seasonal Unemployment** - This arises due to the seasonal nature of some productive activities e.g. production in the
agricultural sector.
**6. Structural Unemployment** - Results either from change in demand occasioned by change in consumer tastes and
preferences or from technological change.
**7. Cyclical Unemployment** - Is caused by business cycles or swings in the economy e.g. depression and boom
**8. Under-employment** - It occurs when people are working less than they would like to work. Or when people are in
jobs that totally underutilize their skills and competence.
**9. Disguised Unemployment** - Individuals do not want to do certain jobs because of their qualifications
**10. The unemployment of Prematurely Retired** - This occurs when people are retrenched before they attain retirement age.

**Causes of Unemployment**

1. Lack of cooperating factors
2. rapid population growth
3. Inappropriate technology
4. Relative factor price distortions
5. The education system
6. seasonal nature of production

7) Rural urban migration

**_Policies for curing Unemployment_**

1. Wage subsidies. Subsidizing wages means lowering wages hence firms will employ more
   people.

```
If the wages is at W and you subsidize, you are lowering wage rates from W to W’ hence
employing more people
```

2. Restructuring the education system to provide more skills so that people become more
   productive.
3. Increasing the number of institutions to train agricultural labor and then subsidize capital
   since labor works with it
4. Increasing incentives by changing product prices. This raises the benefits from labor thus
   causes a shift in the demand for labor
5. Import substitution. More people will be employed in the industries that produce what the
   country used to import
6. Export promotion. This will expand output hence increase labor employment.

### INFLATION

Inflation refers to persistent increase in the general price level over time.
**Deflation**
Deflation refers to persistent downward movement in the general price level overtime for an
aggregate of goods and services.

**_Types of Inflation_**

**Open inflation**
Occurs when there are no barriers to price rise and no government controls

**Suppressed inflation**

## Wage

## LD

## LS

## W

## W’

## L L\* L’

## W\*

## Labour

## LD’

Refers to a situation where demand exceeds supply, but the effect in prices is minimized through
the use of instruments like price controls and rationing of essential goods by government. The
symptoms of this type of inflation include long queues, black markets and diversion of
scarce resources away from essential producing industries to other industries.

**Stagflation**
Occurs when price increases are accompanied by declining output producing unemployment

**Measurement of Inflation**

Inflation is measured by:
(i) The consumer price index (CPI) – measures the relative changes in the prices of a specified set
of market basket of consumer goods, which are bought by a typical urban household regularly.

(ii) The producer price index (PPI) – measures relative changes in the prices of raw materials,
intermediate and finished goods i.e. at all stages of the productive process rather than at the
stage of the ultimate user.

**Causes of Inflation**

**1. Demand-pull Inflation**
It arises from a situation in which aggregate demand persistently exceeds aggregate supply at
current prices. In this case, the aggregate demand (C + I + G) line is too high, resulting to
inflammatory pressure.

Demand-pull inflation is caused by:
(i) Increases in the level of demand for goods and services in a situation of near employment
(ii) A general shortage of goods and services in times of disaster like floods and earthquake.
(iii) Export surplus leading to foreign currency inflows that cause increases in the money
supply. These inflows become a source of inflationary pressure.
(iv) Expansion of government spending by borrowing from the banking system where this is not
marched by an increase in output.

**2. Cost-Push Inflation**
While GDP is below its potential level, costs are increased, perhaps because unions push up wages,
and in an attempt to protect their profit margins firms push up prices. This price increases affects
the cost of other firms and the consumer’s cost of living. As the cost of living goes up, labourers feel
entitles to, and obtains higher wages to offset the higher living costs. Firms again pass on the cost
increase to the consumer in the form of a price increase. The so-called wage – price spiral is at the
heart of cost-push inflation.

The following factors cause cost-push inflation:
(i) Labour unions asking for higher wages without a corresponding increase in
productivity.
(ii) Manufactures fixing high profit margins
(iii) An increase in import price of an essential commodity like crude oil that leads to
escalation of prices in the economy
(iv) Government imposing new taxes of higher taxes
(v) Structural rigidities in production that leads to increasing average costs.

**Effects of Inflation**
Internal Disadvantages
 Income and wealth are redistributed arbitrarily, for inflation imposes a tax on those who hold
money as opposed to those holding real assets. Inflation reduces the standard of living of
persons dependent on fixed incomes, for example, pensioners. It benefits debtors and penalizes
lenders.
 Interest rates rise, both because people require a higher reward for lending money which is
falling in value and also because the government is forced to take anti-inflationary measures.
 Investment is discouraged by government anti-inflation policy. In practice, controls imposed on
prices are more effective than those on costs, particularly those on wages. The result is
discouraged because postponing consumption simply means that goods cost more if bought
later.
 Inflation encourages speculation by the purchase of real assets by borrowing rather than
investment by the use of resources in production. Indeed inflation discourages investment in
long-term projects because possible government anti-inflation policies are difficult to forecast.

 Inefficiency is encouraged because a buoyant seller’ marked blunts competition as higher prices
obtained for their products allow even inefficient firms to survive.
 Inflation generates industrial and social unrest since there is competition for higher incomes.
Thus, because of rising prices, trade unions ask for annual wage rises. Often demands exceed
the rate of inflation, anticipating future rises or seeking a larger share of the national cake to
improve their members’ real standard of living. Those with the most ‘muscle’ gain at the
expense of the weaker groups.
 Additional administrative costs are incurred in offsetting go-slow and work to rule disruptions,
allowing for inflation in negotiating contracts and wage rates, revising price lists and labels,
among others.

 The rate of inflation tends to increase, largely because high wage settlements in anticipation of
higher future price help to bring about the very rise in which people fear.

**External Effects**
Inflation can create serious difficulties for a country that depends on international trade.
These difficulties include:
 Exports tend to decline because they are relatively dearer in foreign markets.
 Imports tend to decline because foreign goods are relatively cheaper compared to Kenyan
goods.
 Higher money incomes in the economy increase the demand for imports and tend to decrease
exports because the buoyant home market makes it less vital for manufacturers to seek outlets
abroad for their goods.
 An outward movement of capital may take place if price rises continue since foreign traders and
financiers lose confidence in the shilling maintaining its current rate of exchange.

However, a positive effect of mild demand-pull inflation is that it may lead to higher investment and
therefore higher employment within the economy.

**Remedies of Inflation
Fiscal and Monetary Policies**
These are also known as demand management policies. They are effective especially against
inflation caused by excess demand.

The fiscal policy measures include:
 A cut in government spending
 Lowering government borrowing
 An increase in taxation
 Introduction of new taxes
These measures directly reduce aggregate demand. The monetary policy refers to actions that aim
at a reduction in money supply or a reduction in its rate of growth. The measures include:
 Restricting direct lending to government
 Increasing cash or liquidity ratio requirement on commercial banks and financial institutions
thereby reducing their ability to create credit.
 Rising interest rate i.e. the cost of borrowing
 Increasing the cost of overnight borrowing by commercial banks.

**Prices and Incomes Policy**
This type of action can take a number of forms as summarized below:
 Government exhortations to firms to avoid unjustified price rises and to unions to avoid
unjustified wage claims
 The setting up of a prices and incomes board to examine proposed price increases and to
contribute to collective bargaining between employers and unions.
 Bringing together of employers’ and unions’ organizations in an attempt to obtain some
voluntary agreement from both parties to keep prices and incomes down.
 The impositions of legislation to regulate or even freeze wages and prices.

**Indexation**
This policy is sometimes called index linking. It works by linking economic variables for example
wages, salaries, and interest payments to an index of inflation like the consumer price index. This
means that as the price index rises, wages, salaries and interest payment rises simultaneously.

The Philips Curve

The Philips curve postulates that in general, the rate of inflation fall as unemployment rises and
vice-versa. The curve therefore shows that there is a trade-off between inflation and
unemployment meaning that a lower rate of inflation could be achieved but only at the cost of
higher rate of unemployment. The Philips curve thus validates the Keynesian argument that in
order to achieve full employment some level of inflation is unavoidable.

### 6. INTERNATIONAL TRADE

It is the exchange of goods and services between one country and another. International Trade
can be in goods, termed visible or in services; termed invisibles e.g. trade in services such as
tourism, shipping and insurance.

**Reasons for the Development of International Trade**
a. Some goods cannot be produced by the country at all. The country may simply not possess
the raw materials that it requires; thus it has to buy them from other countries. The
same would apply to many foodstuffs, where a different climate prevents their cultivation.
b. Some goods cannot be produced as efficiently as elsewhere. In many cases, a country could
produce a particular good, but it would be much less efficient at it than another country.
c. It may be better for the country to give up the production of a good (and import it instead) in
order to specialize in something else. This is in line with the principle of comparative
advantage.
d. In a free market economy, a consumer is free to choose which goods to buy. A foreign good
may be more to his or her liking. This is in line with the principle of competitive forces and
the exercise of choice.
e. Shortages: At a time of high domestic demand for a particular good, production may not
meet this demand. In such a situation, imports tend to be bought to overcome the shortage.

**Theory of Comparative Advantage**
In his theory put forward in a book published in 1817, David Ricardo argued that what was
needed for two countries to engage in international trade was comparative advantage. He
believed that 2 countries can still gain, even if one country is more productive then the other in
all lines of production. Using the Labour Theory Value, Ricardo’s contribution was to show that a
sufficient basis for trade was a difference, not in absolute costs. He illustrated his theory with 2
countries and two commodities, I and II and A and B respectively.

```
Country Cost of Producing One Unit
(in man-hours)
A B
I 8 9
II 12 10
```

We can observe that country I has complete absolute advantage in the production of both
commodities since it can produce them with a lower level of resources. Country I is more
efficient than country II.

Ricardo believed that even then there could still be a basis for trade, so long as country II is not
equally less productive, in all lines of production. It still pays both countries to trade. What is
important is the Comparative Advantage. A country is said to have comparative advantage in the
production of a commodity if it can produce at relatively lower opportunity costs than another
country. (The law of comparative advantage states that a nation should specialize in producing
and exporting those commodities which it can produce at relatively lower costs, and that it
should import those goods in which it is a relatively high cost producer). Ricardo demonstrated
this by introducing the concept of opportunity cost.

```
The opportunity Cost of good A is the amount of other goods which have to be given up in order
to produce one unit of the good. To produce a unit of good A in country I, you need 8 man hours
and 9 man hours to produce good B in the same country. It is thus more expensive to produce
good B then A. The opportunity costs of producing a unit of A is equivalent to 8/9 units of good B.
One unit of B is equal to 9/8 units of A.
```

In country II, one unit of A is equal to 12/10 of B and one unit of B = 10/12 units of A. Therefore
he felt that: -
Opportunity cost of producing one unit of:
A B Country
I 9/8 (1.25) B 8/9 (0.89) A
II 10/12 (0.83) B 12/10 (1.2) A
B is cheaper to produce in country II in terms of resources as opposed to producing it in country I.
The opportunity costs are thus lower in country II than in country I.

```
Consider commodity A valued in terms of B. A cheaper in country I than country II.
```

```
A country has comparative advantage in producing commodity if the opportunity cost of
producing it is lower than in other counties. Country I has a lower opportunity cost in producing
A than B and II has a lower opportunity cost in the production of B than A. In country I, they
should specialize in the production of A and Import B.
```

```
Limitations of Comparative advantage
This doctrine is valid in the case of a classical competitive market characterized by a large
number of informed buyers and sellers and homogenous products in each market, with world
market places serving as efficiency determinants for global allocation of resources to their most
suitable uses. Unfortunately, world markets and their prices are largely inefficient showing
influences of trade barriers, discrimination and market distortions.
```

```
Individual countries systematically aim at maximizing their potential gains from trade rather
than with optimizing the allocation of world resources.
```

```
By pursuing gains from trade in the short run young nations may jeopardize long term
development prospects because:
```

```
i) It is important to protect infant industries to acquire new skills, technology and home markets
that are necessary in the early years of industrial development;
ii) Concentrating on short term comparative advantage may lead to internalizing wrong
externalities e.g. promoting use of illiterate peasants and primary sector production;
iii) Long term movements in commodity terms of trade disfavor primary commodities as their
prices rise more slowly than those of industrial manufactures (income elasticity of demand for
primary commodities is lower than for manufactures and as world incomes rise demand for
the latter rises more rapidly affecting their relative world prices).
```

```
Gains from International Trade
The gains from International trade are to make the participating countries better off than they
would have otherwise been. This will be the result of a number of advantages which a country
can derive from international trade, namely:
```

```
The vent-for-“surplus” product
Many countries have products which are surplus to their own requirements and it is only by
exporting these that they have value at all. Thus, the plantations of coffee in Kenya are only of
value because of the existence of international trade. Without it, the coffee would mainly be
unused and remain unpicked. Many of the primary products that are exported would be of no use
to the country. Without trade, the land and the labor used for their production would be idle.
Trade therefore gives the country the opportunity to sell these products and to make use of the
available land and labor.
```

```
Importation of what cannot be produced
A country has to import what it cannot produce. Certain countries like Japan and Britain could
not manufacture goods without the importation of most of the raw materials. There is thus
necessity for international trade in respect of these essential materials.
```

```
Specialization according to absolute advantage
International trade allows a country to specialize in the production of commodities where it
more efficient than other countries. For instance, if we take a situation in which each country in
a simple two country model has an absolute advantage in producing either fruits or beef but is
able to produce the other commodity only if required (for simplicity we assume constant returns
to scale and full utilization of resources). Suppose that each country has equal resources and
devotes half its limited resources to citrus fruit and half to beef and the production totals are:
```

Units of Citrus fruits Units of Beef

Country X (^10 5)
Country Y 5 10
World total (^15 15)
The relative or comparative cost of citrus production is lower in country X than in country Y, but
the situation is reserved in the case of beef production. Country X has an absolute advantage in
citrus fruit production and Y has an absolute advantage in beef production. If each country
specializes in the production of the commodity in which it is most efficient and possesses
absolute advantage, we get:
Units of Citrus fruits Units of Beef
Country X 20 0
Country Y 0 20
World total 20 20
The gains from trade are obvious with five units more of fruit and five more of beef –Provided we
assume that transport costs are not so enormous as to rule out gains made.
**Specialization according to comparative advantage**
Even if one country can produce the two goods more efficiently at a lower comparative cost than
the other country, there could be gains to be made from International Trade. This possibility is

```
explained by the theory of comparative advantage. Suppose that country X is more efficient in
both citrus fruit and beef production. If each country devoted half its resources to each, let us
imagine the production totals are:
```

```
Units of Citrus fruits Units of Beef
```

```
Country X 30 60
Country Y 20 10
World total 50 70
```

```
Country X possesses an absolute advantage in both industries but whereas X is only 50% more
efficient in the citrus fruit production, it is six times more efficient in beef production. Even so, if
country Y produces an extra unit of citrus fruit it need give up only half a unit of beef. In contrast,
country X must give up two units of beef to increase production of citrus fruits by one unit. It is
evident from this example that although a country may have absolute advantage in the
production of all products, it is possible for a country such as Y to produce some products
relatively cheaply at lower opportunity cost than its trading partner X. When this occurs as in
the simple example above then economists describe X as possessing a comparative advantage in
the production of citrus fruit.
```

```
If each country specializes completely in the activity in which it possesses a comparative
advantage, the production totals are:
Units of Citrus fruits Units of Beef
Country X 0 120
Country Y 40 0
World total 40 120
```

```
What is evident from these last calculations is that although the overall production of beef has
increased, the output of citrus fruit has fallen by ten units. Thus we cannot be sure without some
knowledge of demand and the value placed on the consumption of citrus fruit and beef that a
welfare system gain will result from specialization.
```

```
Competition
Trade stimulates competition. If foreign goods are coming into a country, this puts home
producers on their toes and will force them to become more efficient.
```

```
Introduction of new ideas
International trade can introduce new ideas into a participating country; it can stimulate
entrepreneurship and generate social change. This is especially the case in developing countries
where the development of expert industries can lead to the emergence of a commercial class
desirous of change and opposed to any practice that hold back economic advancement.
```

**Reasons for Protection**
**_Cheap Labour_**
It is often argued that the economy must be protected from imports which are produced with
cheap, or ‘sweated”, labor. Some people argue that buying foreign imports from low wage
countries amounts not only to unfair competition, but continues to encourage the exploitation of

cheap labour in those countries as well as undermining the standard of living of those in high
wage economies.

**_Infant Industry Argument_**
Advocates of this maintain that if an industry is just developing, with a good chance of success
once it is established and reaping economies of scale, then is it necessary to protect it from
competition temporarily until it reaches levels of production and cost which allow it to compete
with established industries elsewhere, until it can “stand on its own feet”. The argument is most
commonly used to justify the high level of protection that surrounds the manufacturing industry
in developing countries, as they attempt to replace foreign goods with those made in their own
country (“import substitution”).

**_Structural Unemployment_**
The decline of the highly localized industry due to international trade causes great problems of
regional (structural) unemployment. If it would take a long time to re-locate the labor to other
jobs, then this can put the government, under considerable political and humanitarian pressure,
to restrict the imports that are causing the industry to decline.

**_Dumping_**
If goods are sold on a foreign market below their cost of production this is referred to as
dumping. This may be undertaken either by a foreign monopolist, using high profits at home to
subsidize exports for political or strategic reasons. Countries in which such products are
“dumped” feel justified in protecting themselves. This is because dumping could result in the
elimination of the home industry, and the country then becomes dependent on foreign goods
which are not as cheap as they had appeared.

**_Balance of Payments_**
Perhaps the most immediate reason for bringing in protection is a balance of payment deficit. If a
country had a persistent deficit in its balance of payments, it is unlikely to be able to finance these
deficits from its limited reserves. If therefore becomes necessary for it adopt some form of
restriction on imports (e.g. tariffs, quotas, foreign exchange restrictions) or some means of
boosting its exports (e.g. export subsidies).

**_Danger of over-specializing_**
A country may feel that in its long-term interests it should not be too specialized.
A country may not wish to abandon production of certain key commodities even though the
foreign product is more competitive, because it is then too dependent on imports of that good. In
the future, its price or supplies may diminish. It is for this reason that countries wish to remain
largely self-sufficient in food. An exporting country may not wish to become overspecialized in a
particular product. Such over specialization may make sense now, but in the future, demand may
fall and the country will suffer disproportionally. It is for this reason that many developing
countries choose not to rely solely on their comparative advantage; they wish to diversify into
other goods as an: insurance policy”.

**_Strategic Reasons_**
For political or strategic reasons, a country may not wish to be dependent upon imports and so
may protect a home industry even if it is inefficient. Many countries maintain industries for

strategic reasons. The steel industry, energy industries, shipping, agriculture and others have
used this strategic defense argument.

**Ways of Restricting International Trade**
The most common means of restricting international trade is through import restrictions. The
main forms are:

**_Tariffs_**
This is a tax on each unit imported. The effect of the tax is to raise the price of imported varieties
of a product in relation to the domestically produced, so that the consumers are discouraged from
buying foreign goods by means of the price mechanism. Such a tax may be ad valorem,
representing a certain percentage of the import price, or specific that is, an absolute charge on the
physical amount imported as, for example, five shillings a ton.

**_Quotas_**
The most direct way of offering protection is by limiting the physical quantity of a good which
may be imported. This can be done by giving only a limited number of import licenses and fixing
a quota on the total amount which may be brought in during the period. The quota may be
imposed in terms of physical quantities or in terms of the value of foreign currency, so that a
maximum of so many “shillings-worth” may be imported.

**_Foreign exchange restriction_**
Exchange controls work much the same way as physical controls. Foreign exchange is not made
available for all desired imports. It can be severely restricted to whatever the government
decides it wants to see imported. Alternatively, the exchange rate may be fixed in such a way as
to “overprice” foreign currency (compared to what would have been the free market price), so
that importers have to pay more for foreign currency (in terms of domestic currency). This
makes all imports dearer and thus gives protection “across the board” to all domestic production
for the home market.

**_Procurement policies by government_**
The government itself, together with state corporations, is an important purchaser of goods; in its
“procurement” policies, therefore, it can either buy goods from the cheapest source, whether
domestic or foreign, or it can give preference to domestic producers. This could amount to a
substantial advantage, or protection.
