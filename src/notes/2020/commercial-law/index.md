## Introduction

### Defination of law

No single definition will prove acceptable to all students of thought, but whatever law may not be, it can be defined as:
“a collection of rules of human conduct prescribed by human beings for obedience of human beings”
Business law, like definition of law, has no universal definition. H. W. Disney in the book “Elements of Commercial Law” says; Commercial law is an expression incapable of strict definition but is used as all that portion of law of England which is more especially concerned with trade and business.
Business law can be defined as special rules which apply to the contracts to the sale of goods and such other contracts that are concilliary thereto namely contracts for the carriage of and insurance of goods and contracts the main purpose of which is to finance the carrying out of a contract of sale.
According to Roy Goode, it is that branch of law which is concerned with the rights and duties arising from the supply of goods and services in a way of trade.

### Branches of Law

The law of the state is divided into two main categories:

• Public law
• Private law

#### Public Law

Public law consists of those fields of law in which the state has an interest and includes:

    a) Constitutional law – rules which regulate the relationship between different organs of state.

    b) Administrative law – law relating to public administration

    c) Criminal law – consists of wrongs committed against the state. (contained in the Penal Code – the offences against the person, property and against the security of the state)

#### Private Law

Private law is that part of the law which is primarily concerned with the rights and duties of persons towards persons. It includes:

    a) Law of torts
    b) Law of contract
    c) Law of property
    d) Law of succession
    e) Business Law

    • International law – consists of that body of law which regulates the relations between states. It is based on custom, treaties and conventions.

    • Private international law – is a further branch of aw. It is mainly concerned with determination of what system of state law shall apply in a case which contains a foreign element. For example; a Kenyan enters into a contract with a Somali in Somalia which is to be performed in Sudan and a breach of that contract occurs and the Kenyan wishes to sue in Kenya, the Kenyan court will have to decide which system of law to apply.

#### Sources of Kenyan Law

These sources are contained in Section 3 of the Judicature Act (Cap 8) Laws of Kenya.
They are:

    A. LEGISLATION

It includes:
i. Acts of Parliament (section 3(1)(b) – all other written laws
Specific Acts of the parliament of the United Kingdom (cited in the schedule to the Judicature Act and the Law of Contract Act (Cap 23)
One Act of the Parliament of India (ITPA)
English statutes of general application in force in England on 12th august , 1897
English laws were accepted in Kenya through the Reception clause
A. SUBSIDIARY LEGISLATION
It is part of the written law and is therefore a source of law. It is also known as delegated legislation. Legislation is one of the functions of Parliament. When Parliament delegates that function to another person or body, it then becomes known as delegated legislation.
Local authorities, statutory bodies an professional bodies like LSK and council of Legal Education exercise a delegated power to legislate. The bulk of legislation, however, stems from the government departments. When parliament delegates to the Ministers the power to legislate, it is in effect giving the power to civil servants. All subsidiary legislation is made under the express authority of an Act of Parliament and must comply with any procedure laid down by the parent Act.

    B. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ENGLISH COMMON LAW, THE DOCTRINES OF EQUITY AND THE STATUTES OF GENERAL APPLICATION IN FORCE IN ENGLAND ON THE 12TH AUGUST, 1897.

Common law consists of the ancient customs and usages of England which have been recognised and given the force of law. English common law and the doctrines of equity remain a source of Kenyan law but “so far as the circumstances of Kenya and its inhabitants permit and subject to such qualifications as those circumstances may render necessary.
Equity refers to rules, doctrines and principles that were applied and developed by the court of chancery before the enactment of the Judicature Act of 1873.
Equity also refers to concept of justice and fairness taking into account such matters as ethics, morality, good faith and good conscious.
Doctrines of equity – they are unwritten and are applied whenever subsequent disputes of similar nature arise – ratio decidendi – and the decisions known as precedence.
Examples of doctrines of Equity
• Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy.
Equity follows the law (does not override the law)
He who seeks equity must do equity
Where equities are equal, the law prevails
Where equities are equal, the first in time prevails
He who comes to equity must do so with clean hands
Delay defeats equity
Equity aids the vigilant and not the indolent

    A. AFRICAN CUSTOMARY LAW

They apply in civil cases in which one or more of the parties is subject to it or affected by it, so far as it is applicable and is not repugnant to justice and morality, or inconsistent with any written law.
