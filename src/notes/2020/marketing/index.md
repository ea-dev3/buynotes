## Introduction

Many large and small organizations seek success. A myriad of factors contribute to making a business successful - strategy, dedicated employees, good information systems, excellent implementation. However, today's successful companies at all levels have one thing in common - they are strongly customer-focused and heavily committed to marketing. These companies share an absolute dedication to sensing, serving and satisfying the needs of customers in well-defined target markets. They motivate everyone in the organization to deliver high quality and superior value for their customers, leading to high levels of customer satisfaction. These organizations know that if they take care of their customers, market share and profits will follow. Marketing, more than any other business function, deals with customers. Creating customer value and satisfaction are at the very heart of modern marketing thinking and practice.

### Defining Marketing

Marketing is the process of creating consumer value in the form of goods, services, or ideas that can improve the consumer’s life. Marketing is the delivery of customer satisfaction at a profit. Marketing is a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating and exchanging products of value with others (Philip Kotler). The goal of marketing is to attract new customers by promising superior value, and to keep current customers by delivering satisfaction.

###### What do Marketers Think About?

• How will I promote my product?
• How can I insure customer loyalty?

Marketing is....getting the right products to the right people at the right price and at the right place and time with the right promotion.

###### Simple Questions, Hard Answers

    • Who are our customers?
    • What important & unique benefits do we provide?
    • Are these benefits sustainable

### Core marketing concepts

To have more clear view about the marketing and to understand the marketing process first we should discuss the some basic concepts that marketing revolves around.

a. Needs, wants, and demands
Needs: Human needs are the most basic concept underlying marketing. A human need is a state of felt deprivation. Humans have many complex needs.
a). Basic, physical needs for food, clothing, warmth, and safety.
b).Social needs for belonging and affection.
c). Individual needs for knowledge and self-expression.
Wants A human want is the form that a human need takes as shaped by culture and individual personality.
Demands are human wants that are backed by buying power.
1). Consumers view products as bundles of benefits and choose products that give them the best bundle for their money.
2). People demand products with the benefits that add up to the most satisfaction. Outstanding marketing companies go to great lengths to learn about and understand their customer’s needs, wants, and demands. The outstanding company strives to stay close to the customer.

b. Products and Services: A product is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy a need or want. A service is an activity or benefit offered for sale that is essentially intangible and does not result in the ownership of anything. The concept of product is not limited to physical objects and can include experiences, persons, places, organizations, information, and ideas.

c. Value, satisfaction, and quality
Customer value is the difference between the values that the customer gains from owning and using a product and the costs of obtaining the product. Customers do not often judge product values and costs accurately or objectively--they act on perceived value.
Customer satisfaction depends on a product’s perceived performance in delivering value relative to a buyer’s expectations. If performance exceeds expectations, the buyer is delighted (certainly a worthy goal of the marketing company).
Total quality management (TQM) is an approach in which all the company’s people are involved in constantly improving the quality of products, services, and marketing processes.

d. Exchange, transactions, and relationships
Marketing occurs when people decide to satisfy needs and wants through exchange.
Exchange is the act of obtaining a desired object from someone by offering something in return. Exchange is only one of many ways to obtain a desired object. Exchange is the core concept of marketing. A transaction (a trade of values between two parties) is marketing’s unit of measurement. Most involve money, a response, and action. Transaction marketing is part of a larger idea of relationship marketing. Beyond creating short-term transactions, marketers need to build long- term relationships with valued customers, distributors, dealers, and suppliers. Ultimately, a company wants to build a unique company asset called a marketing network (the company and all its supporting stakeholders). The goal of relationship marketing is to deliver long-term value to the customer and thereby secure customer satisfaction and retention of patronage.

e. Markets
The concepts of exchange and relationships lead to the concept of a market. A market is the set of actual and potential buyers of a product.

### Marketing funtions

There are eight Universal functions that are performed in marketing. These are:
• Buying: (Raw material to produce goods and services and to purchase finished goods or services as retailer or whole seller to sell them again for final customers and consumers). It is a function that ensures that product offerings are available in sufficient quantities to meet customer demands.
• Selling: The function to be performed to sell the products/services/idea to satisfy customer needs or wants. Using advertising, personal selling, and sales promotion to match goods and services to customer needs
• Transporting: Function related to create the availability of product or services. It is used for moving products from their points of production to location convenient for purchases
• Storing: Warehouses are used to store the products for further distribution.
• Standardizing and grading: To provide more quality products and services without variation in the quality. Ensuring that product offerings meet established and grading quality and quantity control standards of size, weight, and other product variables
• Financing: Providing the financial resources to carry out different function e.g. promotion of product and providing credit for channel members (wholesalers, retailers) or consumers
• Risk taking: Marketer takes a risk specifically when any new product is introduced in a market because there are equal chances of success and failure. Dealing with uncertainty about consumer purchases resulting from creation and marketing of goods and services that consumers may purchase in the future
• Securing Marketing Information: Collecting information about consumers, competitors, information and channel members (wholesalers, and retailers) for use in making marketing decisions

### Marketing Management

Marketing management is “the art and science of choosing target markets and building profitable relationships with them.” The marketer’s basic skill lies in influencing the level, timing, and composition of demand for a product, service, organization, place, person, idea, or some form of information. Marketing Management is also defined as the analysis, planning, implementation, and control of programs designed to create, build, and maintain beneficial exchanges with target buyers for the purpose of achieving organizational objectives. Marketing management involves:
• Demand Management -
At any point in time, there may be no demand, adequate demand, irregular demand or too much demand, and marketing management must find ways to deal with these different demand states. Marketing management is concerned not only with finding and increasing demand, but also with changing or even reducing it.
Demarketing: Marketing to reduce demand temporarily or permanently; the aim is not to destroy demand but only to reduce or shift it. Demarketing’s aim is to reduce demand temporarily or permanently (move traffic away from a popular tourist attraction during peak demand times). In reality, marketing management is really demand management.
• Building Profitable Customer Relationships -
Beyond designing strategies to attract new customers, marketing organizations also go all out to retain current customers and build lasting customer relationships. Two components of relationship marketing are:

1.  Customer Focus
2.  Competitive Advantage

It is more profitable to keep loyal customers than to constantly be attracting new ones.

### Marketing philosophies

What philosophy should guide a company's marketing efforts? The competing concepts under which organizations have conducted marketing activities include: the production concept, product concept, selling concept, marketing concept, and holistic marketing concept.

• The Production Concept -
One of the oldest concepts in business under which the businessmen produce goods thinking customers are interested only in low priced, extensively and easily available goods. It holds that consumers will prefer products that are widely available and inexpensive. Managers of production-oriented businesses concentrate on achieving high production efficiency, low costs, and mass distribution. Such organizations have only sales department which sell product at a price set by production and finance department.

    • The Product Concept -

It holds that consumers will favor those products that offer the most quality, performance, or innovative features. Managers in these organizations focus on making superior products and improving them over time. They believe that consumers are willing to pay higher cost for the goods or services which have extra quality. Too much focus on product may go off the track and fail.

    • The Selling Concept

It holds that consumers and businesses, if left alone, will ordinarily not buy enough of the organization's products. The organization must, therefore, undertake an aggressive selling and promotion effort. This concept is practiced most aggressively with unsought goods, goods that buyers normally do not think of buying, such as electrical equipments, soft drink/health drink companies, insurance, encyclopedias, and funeral plots. Most firms practice the selling concept when they have overcapacity. Their aim is to sell what they make rather than make what the market wants. Marketers who follow selling concept often forget the taste of consumers and not interested in the feedback of consumers.  They use fair and unfair means of persuasion to increase sales.  They are not interested in building a network of satisfied customers and target new customers for selling their products.

    • The Marketing Concept -

It holds that the key to achieving organizational goals consists of the company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value to its chosen target markets. Under marketing concept the task of marketing begins with finding what the consumer want and produce a product which will meet the consumer requirement and provides maximum satisfaction.  "Customer is the King" concept emerged from this point of view. When an organization practice the marketing concept, all their activities  such as research and development, distribution, quality control, finance, manufacturing, selling etc., are focused to satisfy the consumer needs and wants

    • The Holistic Marketing Concept -

The holistic marketing concept is based on the development, design, and implementation of marketing programs, processes, and activities that recognizes their breadth and inter-dependencies. Holistic marketing recognizes that "everything matters" with marketing— and that a broad, integrated perspective is often necessary. Holistic marketing is thus an approach to marketing that attempts to recognize and reconcile the scope and complexities of marketing activities. Four components of holistic marketing are relationship marketing, integrated marketing, internal marketing, and social responsibility marketing.

• Relationship marketing: Increasingly, a key goal of marketing is to develop deep, enduring relationships with all people or organizations that could directly or indirectly affect the success of the firm's marketing activities. Relationship marketing has the aim of building mutually satisfying long-term relationships with key parties—customers, suppliers, distributors, and other marketing partners—in order to earn and retain their business.

• Integrated marketing: The marketer's task is to devise marketing activities and assemble fully integrated marketing programs to create, communicate, and deliver value for consumers. The marketing program consists of numerous decisions on value-enhancing marketing activities to use. Marketing activities come in all forms. One traditional depiction of marketing activities is in terms of the marketing mix, which has been defined as the set of marketing tools the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives. McCarthy classified these tools into four broad groups, which he called the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.
The firm can change its price, sales force size, and advertising expenditures in the short run. It can develop new products and modify its distribution channels only in the long run. Thus the firm typically makes fewer period-to-period marketing-mix changes in the short run than the number of marketing-mix decision variables might suggest.
Two key themes of integrated marketing are that (1) many different marketing activities are employed to communicate and deliver value and (2) all marketing activities are coordinated to maximize their joint effects.

• Internal marketing: Holistic marketing incorporates internal marketing, ensuring that everyone in the organization embraces appropriate marketing principles, especially senior management. Internal marketing is the task of hiring, training, and motivating able employees who want to serve customers well.
