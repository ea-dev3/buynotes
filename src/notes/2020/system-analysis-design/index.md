## Introduction

### The concept of systems analysis and design

Currently companies use information as a weapon in the battle to increase productivity, deliver quality products and services, maintain customer loyalty, and make sound decisions. In a global economy with intense competition, information technology can mean the difference between success and failure.

### The Impact of Information Technology

Information technology (IT) refers to the combination of hardware, software, and services that people use to manage communicate, and share information. More than ever, business success depends on information technology. IT is driving a new digital economy, where advances in hardware, software, and connectivity can provide enormous benefits to businesses and individuals. The reason is simple during periods of growth; companies cannot afford to lag behind the IT curve .

Conversely, when the economy slows down, firms often use IT to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency.

#### The Future

If you ask a group of IT professionals to name a company that has been successful for over 100 years, the answer probably would be IBM. As its name suggests, International Business Machines was a major supplier of typewriters and data processing equipment long before the computer era. As a longtime IT leader, IBM’s predictions deserve close attention.

The company that became IBM was founded in 1896 by Herman Hollerith, who invented the punched card system shown in Figure1-3. Hollerith wanted toanalyze the 1890 census data, and his idea was brilliant. First, letters and numbers
were coded by being punched into specific locations on a card. His machines then used a simple electrical circuit to detect the position of the holes and recognize the characters.

This concept transformed a set of punched cards into what we would call a database, which could be sorted, queried, and printed. Punched card technology revolutionized data storage, and was the main form of information management well into the 1960s and beyond. The concept still is used with some types of voting forms and other documents.

Today, IBM is a global giant with a half-million employees, numerous patents, and more Nobel Prize winners than any other IT firm. In its 2009 Annual Report, IBM chairman Samuel J. Palmisano noted three issues that will shape the future of IT and guide the company’s strategy. These include changes in the world, changes in technology, and changes in client demand. IT professionals should study these trends and prepare for the future.

#### System analysis and design

Systems analysis and design is a step-by-step process for developing high-quality information systems.
An information system combines information technology, people, and data to support business requirements.

For example, information systems handle daily business transactions, improve company productivity, and help managers make sound decisions. The IT department team includes systems analysts who plan, develop, and maintain information systems.
With increasing demand for talented people, employment experts predict a shortage of qualified applicants to fill IT positions. Many companies list employment opportunities on their Web sites.

#### Who develops information systems?

Traditionally, a company developed its own information systems, called in-house applications, or purchased systems called software packages from outside vendors. Today, the choice is much more complex. Options include Internet-based application services, outsourcing, custom solutions from IT consultants, and enterprise-wide software strategies.
Regardless of the development method, launching a new information system involves risks as well as benefits. The greatest risk occurs when a company tries to decide how the system will be constructed before determining what the system needs to do. Instead of putting the cart before the horse, a company must begin by outlining its business needs and identifying possible IT solutions. Typically, this important work is performed by systems analysts and other IT professionals. A firm should not consider implementation options until it has a clear set of objectives. Later on, as the system is developed, a systems analyst’s role will vary depending on the implementation option selected.

#### Infomation System Components

A system is a set of related components that produces specific results. For example, A mission-critical system is one that is vital to a company’s operations. An order processing system, for example, is mission-critical because the company cannot do business without it. Every system requires input data. For example, your computer receives data when you press a key or click a menu command. In an information system, data consists of basic facts that are the system’s raw material.

Information is data that has been transformed into output that is valuable to users. An information system has five key components which include:-

• Hardware - consists of everything in the physical layer of the information system. For example, hardware can include
servers, workstations, networks, telecommunications equipment, fiber-optic cables, mobile devices, scanners, digital capture devices, and other technology-based infrastructure.

• Software - refers to the programs that control the hardware and produce the desired information or results. Software consists of system software and application software.

a) System software manages the hardware components, which can include a single workstation or a global network with many thousands of clients. Either the hardware manufacturer supplies the system software or a company purchases it from a vendor. Examples of system software include the operating system, security software that protects the computer from intrusion, device drivers that communicate with hardware such as printers, and utility programs that handle specific tasks such as data backup and disk management. System software also controls the flow of data, provides data security, and manages network operations. In today’s interconnected business world, network software is vitally important.

b) Application software consists of programs that support day-to-day business functions and provide users with the information they require. Application software can serve one user or thousands of people throughout an organization. Examples of company- wide applications, called enterprise applications, include order processing systems, payroll systems, and company communications networks. individual users increase their productivity with tools such as
spreadsheets, word processors, and database management systems. Most companies use a combination of software that is acquired at various times. When planning an information system, a company must consider how a new system will interface with older systems, which are called legacy systems.

For example, a new human resources system might need to exchange data with an older payroll application.

i) Data is the raw material that an information system transforms into useful information. An information system can store data in various locations, called tables. By linking the tables, the system can extract specific information. Linked
tables work together to supply different data items to the screen form. Users, who would not know or care where or how the data is stored

ii) Processes describe the tasks and business functions that users, managers, and IT staff members perform to achieve specific results. Processes are the building blocks of an information system because they represent actual day-to-day business operations. To build a successful information system, analysts must understand business processes and document themcarefully.

iii) People who have an interest in an information system are called stakeholders. Stakeholders include the management group responsible for the system, the users also called end users inside and outside the company who will interact with the system, and IT staff members, such as systems analysts, programmers, and network administrators who develop and support the system.

#### Understand the business

IT professionals must understand a company’s operations to design successful systems. Each business situation is different. For example, a retail store, a medical practice, and a hotel chain all have unique information systems requirements. Systems analysts use a process called business process modeling to represent companyoperations and information needs. Business process modeling requires a business profile and a series of models that document business processes. As the business world changes, systems analysts can expect to work in new kinds of companies that require innovative IT solutions, including Web-based systems that serve customers and carry out online transactions with other businesses.

##### Business Profile

A business profile is an overview of a company’s mission, functions, organization, products, services, customers, suppliers, competitors, constraints, and future direction. Although much of this information is readily available, a systems analyst usually needs to do additional research and fact-finding. A business profile is the starting point for the modeling process.

##### Business Process

A business process is a specific set of transactions, events, and results that can be described and documented. A business process model (BPM) graphically displays one or more business processes, such as handling an airline reservation,
filling a product order, or updating a customer account.

For complex operations, however, analysts apply computer-based modeling tools that use a standard language called business process modeling notation (BPMN). BPMN includes various shapes and symbols to represent events, processes, and
workflows, such as Microsoft Visio, and computer-aided software engineering programs

#### Current Trends

Traditionally, IT companies were identified as product-oriented or service-oriented. Product-oriented firms manufactured computers, routers, or the microchips whereas service-oriented companies included vendors, software
developers, and service providers. Today, those distinctions are gone. Most successful IT companies offer a mix of
products, services, and support. Value-added services such as consulting, financing, and technical support can be more profitable than hardware.

### Impact of the Internet

Internet-based commerce is called e-commerce (electronic commerce) or I-commerce (Internet commerce).
Internet-based systems involve various hardware and software designs, but a typical model is a web based application that provides a user interface, which communicates with database management software and a Web-based data server.
As Internet-based commerce continues to grow, career opportunities will expand significantly for IT professionals such as Web designers, mobile application developers, database developers, and systems analysts.

#### Structered analysis

Structured analysis is a traditional systems development technique that is time-tested and easy to understand. Structured analysis uses a series of phases, called the systems development life cycle (SDLC), to plan, analyze, design, implement,
and support an information system. Although structured analysis evolved many years ago, it remains a popular systems
development method.

Structured analysis is based on an overall plan, similar to a blueprint for constructing a building, so it is called a predictive approach. Structured analysis uses a set of process models to describe a system graphically.

Because it focuses on processes that transform data into useful information, structured analysis is called a process-centered technique. In addition to modeling the processes, structured analysis also addresses data organization and structure, relational database design, and user interface issues.

A process model shows the data that flows in and out of system processes. Inside each process, input data is transformed by business rules that generate the output.

#### System development life-cycle

Structured analysis uses the SDLC to plan and manage the systems development process. The SDLC describes activities and functions that all systems developers perform, regardless of which approach they use. In the waterfall model, the result of each phase is called a deliverable, or end product, which flows into the next phase. Some analysts see a disadvantage in the built-in structure of the SDLC, because the waterfall model does not emphasize interactivity among the phases.

##### Five stages or phases of SDLC

The SDLC model usually includes five stages which include:-

    a) System Planning-- The systems planning phase usually begins with a formal request to the IT department, called a systems request, which describes problems or desired changes in an information system or a business process.In many companies, IT systems planning is an integral part of overall business planning. When managers and users develop their business plans, they usually include IT requirements that generate systems requests.A systems request can come from a top manager, a planning team, a department head, or the IT department itself. The request can be very significant or relatively minor. A major request might involve a new information system or the upgrading of an existing system. In contrast, a minor request might ask for a new feature or a change to the user interface. The purpose of this phase is to perform a preliminary investigation to evaluate an IT-related business opportunity or problem. The preliminary investigation is a critical step because the outcome will affect the entire development process.

    A key part of the preliminary investigation is a feasibility study that reviews anticipated costs and benefits and recommends a course of action based on operational, technical, economic, and time factors. Suppose you are a systems analyst and you receive a request for a system change or improvement.Your first step is to determine whether it makes sense to launch a preliminary investigation at all. Often you will need to learn more about business operations before you can reach a conclusion.After an investigation, you might find that the information system functions properly, but users need more training. In some situations, you might recommend a business process review, rather than an IT solution.In other cases, you might conclude that a full-scale systems review is necessary. If the development process continues, the next step is the systems analysis phase.

    b) System Analysis - The purpose of the systems analysis phase is to build a logical model of the new system. The first step is requirements modeling, where you investigate business processes and document what the new system must do to satisfy users. Requirements’ modeling then follows the investigation started during the systems planning phase. To understand the system, you perform fact-finding using techniques such as interviews, surveys, document review, observation, and sampling. Then use the fact finding results to build business models, data and process models, and object models. The deliverable for the systems analysis phase is the system requirements document, which describes management and user requirements, costs and benefits, and outlines alternative development strategies.

    c) The purpose of the systems design phase is to create a physical model that will satisfy all documented requirements for the system.At this stage, you design the user interface and identify necessary outputs, inputs, and processes. In addition, you design internal and external controls, including computer-based and manual features to guarantee that the system will be reliable, accurate, maintainable, and secure.

    During the systems design phase, you also determine the application architecture,which programmers will use to transform the logical design into program modules and code. The deliverable for this phase is the system design specification, which is presented to management and users for review and approval. Management and user involvement is critical to avoid any misunderstanding about what the new system will do, how it will do it, and what it will cost.

    d) Systems Implementation - During the systems implementation phase, the new system is constructed.Whether the developers use structured analysis or O-O methods, the procedure is the same — programs are written, tested, and documented, and the system is installed. If the system was purchased as a package, systems analysts configure the software and perform any necessary modifications. The objective of the systems implementation phase is to deliver a completely functioning and documented information system. At the conclusion of this phase, the system is ready for use. Final preparations include converting data to the new system’s files, training users, and performing the actual transition to the new system. The systems implementation phase also includes an assessment, called a systems evaluation, to determine whether the system operates properly and if costs and benefits are within expectations.

    e) System support and security - During the systems support and security phase, the IT staff maintains, enhances, and protects the system. Maintenance changes correct errors and adapt to changes in the environment. Enhancements provide new features and benefits. The objective during this phase is to maximize return on the IT investment. Security controls safeguard the system from both external and internal threats. A well-designed system must be secure, reliable, maintainable, and scalable.A scalable design can expand to meet new business requirements and volumes.Information systems development is always a work in progress. Business processes change rapidly, and most information systems need to be updated significantly or replaced after several years of operation.
