THE MEANING OF ECONOMICS.
Economics is a social science that has been in existence for about two centuries. Various
economists have tried to define it differently. Three types of definition can be identified.

a) Wealth definition
b) Welfare definition
c) Scarcity definition
a) Wealth definition

Adam smith and his disciples J.B. Say, Walker, J.S. Mill defined economics as an
inquiry into the nature and courses of wealth of nations. Such a definition has been
criticized as follows.

(i) The definition is very selfish: it restricts economics to the study of wealth
alone. The definition does not state clearly how man comes into the study.
(ii) Since economics is defined in terms of material commodity, it doesn’t
consider service e.g. services offered by doctors, teachers, etc.
b) Material welfare definition of economics

Alfred Marshall and his disciples, Pigou and Cannon defined economics as the study
of man’s activities in the ordinary business of life. It tries to study how man
acquires and uses his resources aimed at improving the welfare of mankind. In this
definition, it can be noted that on the one hand, economics is the study of wealth and
on the other hand, and more important, a study of man.
Critism of the definition
(i) The definition excludes the study of services, that is, it only takes human
material welfare.
(ii) Speaks of study of man’s activities during ordinary business of life. The
question remains, how about during extra ordinary business life?
c) Scarcity definition of economics

Leonel Robbin (1933) improved upon the above definition and explained economics
as the study of human behavior (as a relationship between scarce resources which
have alternative uses)
The definition has characteristics that are currently addressed in economics namely
 Limited/scarce resources
 Alternative uses
 Unlimited wants
Scarcity: when we say that a resource is scarce, it means that it is there but cannot meet
the demand. The scarce productive resource would include, land, labor, capital,
entrepreneurship, and by extension technology used in the production process.

Alternative uses: some resources may be having more than one use. For example milk
can make butter, cheese, chocolate etc.

Unlimited wants: human needs are unlimited and they are recurrent in that when you
satisfy a need today, the same need has to be satisfied tomorrow. They are also
competitive in that they compete for the limited resources.

Based on the above definition, economists today agree on a general working definition of
the discipline. They conclusively define economics as the study of how man can use his
scarce resources to satisfy his needs.

Thus, we study economics in order to solve economic problem, which is that of allocating
scarce resources among competing and unlimited wants in such a manner that greatest
satisfaction is derived. To do this, the society will have to make a choice on what
combination of goods and services to produce and what therefore to sacrifice. The quality
that one foregoes/sacrifices in order to consume more of another is what is known as
opportunity cost.

The concept of scarcity and opportunity cost.

Here we shall illustrate how two goods would be produced using the available scarce
resources.

A
A 1
0 B 1 B
O 1
PPF
Maize (Bags)
Beans (Bags)
*N
*M
The slope of the PPF is marginal rate of transformation (MRT)

The straight PPF represents constant opportunity cost. This means that factors of

production can be usedin production of the two commodities equally efficiently

For increasing opportunity Cost, the following diagram is used;

C
D
Maize (bags)
Beans (bags)
Illustrated by a PPF concave to the origin.

 For simplicity assume that a country has same resources to enable her produce only
two goods, namely beans and maize. If all resources are used to produce beans, OA
units will be realized worth zero (0) units of maize. On the other hand, if all resources
are used to produce maize, OB units will be produced with zero (0) units of beans.
Thus the line joining point A and B is the production possibility frontier (PPF) or
curve. The frontier joins together different combinations of goods (beans and
maize) which a country can produce using all available resources and efficiently.

 All points inside PPF like M are attainable though they reflect under utilization or
inefficiency in the use of resources.

 All points outside PPF like N are unattainable because resources are scarce.

 Thus points along AB are attainable and reflect efficient production.

 Suppose initially production was at point A, then only beans would be produced, to
produce OB, units of maize would thus require OA units of beans be sacrificed.
Quantity OA, units of beans which has to be forgone to produce OB units of maize is
the opportunity cost of producing the maize. Sacrificing of production of one good for
the other is as a result of scarcity of resources.

The nature and scope of economics.
(i) Scope of economics

Question; how does economics differ from other subjects? Economics involves the study
of the problem of production, consumption, exchange and distribution of wealth as well
as the determination of the values of goods and services. Besides, economics makes an
inquiry into the possible causes and remedies of poverty, unemployment,
underdevelopment, inflation etc.

The subject consists of a body of general principals and theories which may be applied to
the interpretation of all economic problems, post and present. The fundamental economic
problem of all nations seeks to address the following issues.

 What goods and services to produce
 How to produce them
 For whom to produce
(ii) Methodology of economics.

There are two approaches to the study of economics namely positive and normative
analysis.

Positive analysis (deductive): is more central to micro-economics and it is concerned
with what is, what was, and what will be. That is it is more specific and objective. It
employs economic theory in explaining and predicting circumstances. The economic
theories are tested against observations and are used to construct models from which
prediction are made.

A theory therefore is a reasoned assumption intended to explain an occurrence or a
phenomenon. A model on the other hand is a mathematical representation based on the
economic theory.

Incase of controversies in positive analysis, we refer to economic theories that have been
proven through empirical observations.

Normative analysis (inductive): goes beyond theory to ask questions like “what is best,
what ought to be” etc. it is subjective meaning that it depends on value judgment on what
is desirable.

Incase of controversies, individual policy choices will rule. It is concerned with
alternative policy actions that helps in illuminating and sharpening debates.

Example to help distinguish between positive and normative.
Government imposes tax on a good; effect of this would be

 Increase price of commodity

 Good expensive than competing product

 As quantity demanded falls, firms to decrease number of workers employed.

(Positive analysis; what is, what will be)
Normative analysis: For the firm on whom the product has been imposed they would
ask; what should they do to improve their sales?

How should they improve competitiveness (normative – what ought to be)

BRANCHES OF ECONOMICS
Economics is divided into two main branches:- microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Microeconomics

 Deals with the behaviors of individual economic units. These units include
consumers, workers, investors, owners of; land, business firms, infact any individual
or entity that plays a role in the function of our economy.

 Microeconomics explains how and why these units make economic decisions. For
example, it explains how consumers make purchasing decision and how their choices
are affected by changing prices and income

 It also explains how firms decide how many workers to hire and how workers decide
where to work and how much work to do.

 Another important concern of microeconomics is how economic units interact to form
large units-markets and industries. By studying the behavior and interaction of
individual firm and
consumers, microeconomics reveal how industries and markets operate and evolve,
why they differ from one another, and how they are affected by government policies
and global economic conditions.

Macroeconomics

By contrast, macroeconomics, the other major branch of economics, deals with aggregate
economic quantities, such as the level and growth rate of national output, interest rates,
unemployment and inflation.

 But the boundary between macroeconomics has become less and less distinct in the
recent years. The reason is that macroeconomics also involves the analysis of markets
for goods and services and for labour.

 To understand how these aggregate markets operate, one must first understand the
behavior of the firms, consumers, workers, and investors who make up these markets.
Thus macroeconomists have become increasingly concerned with microeconomics
foundation of aggregate economic phenomena and much of macroeconomics is
actually an extension of microeconomic analysis.

THE ELEMENTARY PRICE THEORY: DEMAND AND SUPPLY
By the end of the lecture, the learner should be able to:

Define demand and supply.
Determine the factors affecting demand and supply.
Define the laws of demand and supply
Distinguish the concept of movement along and shift of the demand and
supply curves.
DEMAND
Demand is defined as, the amount of a commodity people are willing and able to buy at
all possible prices and in a given time.

There is a difference between demand and wants, in that demand are human desires that
are fully backed by the ability to pay. On the other hand, wants are human needs that are
not backed by ability to pay.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE QUALTITY DEMANDED

 Price of the commodity itself

 Price of other commodities which are related to the good in question (be they
substitute or complementary) (Py)

 Consumer income (y)

 Consumer taste and preference for the good (T)

 Advertisement (A)

 Consumer expectation about future prices (E)

 Size of population and its composition (N)

 Credit availability (C )

 Other factors (Z)

Using a functional notation we come up with the following demand function

Dx= f(px,py Ty AE,,,,, NC,, Z)........................................ (1.. )
This simply states that the individual demand for good X is a function of all the factors
listed in the brackets.

i) The price of the commodity itself
In order to analyze the effects of price on quantity demanded of the commodity,
we hold all other factors fixed. the relationship between price and demand can be
explained by the help of the law of demand. According to Alfred Marshall this
law is defined as, “other things being equal, with a fall in price, the demand
for the commodity is extended (increases), and with a rise in the price, the
demand is contracted (decreased)”
This law can be explained with the help of a demand schedule and diagram.
Demand Schedule: is a tabular representation of the quantity demanded of a
good at given price level and at a given point in time.
Demand diagrams on the other hand is a graphical representation of the content
of the demand schedule.
Demand schedule
From this demand schedule, a demand curve can be plotted as shown below.
In the above diagram it is seen that the demand curve slopes downwards from left
to right showing that at higher prices less is demanded and at low prices more is
demanded. We can thus say that for normal demand curve, less is demanded at
higher prices and more is demanded at low prices.

REASONS FOR THE DOWNWARD SLOPING DEMAND CURVE.

i) Lowering prices brings in new buyers who were not able to buy at the previous
price.

ii) Reduction of price may coax out some extra purchases by each of the initial
consumers of the goods, while a rise in price may lead to less purchases.
Naturally, consumers will try to substitute the commodity with another cheaper
one.
Note also that a fall in price implies a rise in real income, hence the ability to
purchase more of the same good.

iii) Whenever a commodity becomes expensive its consumption normally will be left
for only very important uses. For instance a consumer may opt to use electricity
lighting only, and not for cooking if its prices sky rocket. The vice versa is also
true.

EXCEPTION TO THE LAW OF DEMAND

There exists cause where demand may slope upwards instead of downwards from left to
right.

In the case of Giffen goods:- Giffen goods (named after the economist Sir Robert Giffen)
are very inferior goods for which demand increase as price rises and decrease as price
falls. This applies to poor communities.. e.g. In Asia people’s stable food is rice. If price
of rice was to fall, consumers may reduce their demand for rice or consume the same
amount of rice.

> (i) Veblen good (goods of ostentation)

Goods associated with the rich, luxury goods such as jewellery, luxurious vehicles etc.
the value of such goods (quality) is measured by how much expensive it is. For such
goods, the higher the price, the higher will be the demand.

> 0
> ∂
> ∂
> p
> Q
> (ii) Fear of future rise in price

fear of future rise in price makes consumers buy more quantities of different goods even
at higher prices than before because they know that if they dent buy more now, they will
have to pay much higher prices in future.

The existence of such goods and factors explain why under exceptional case the demand
curve may be positively sloped as below.

CONCEPT OF MOVEMENT ALONG DEMAND CURVE AND
SHIFT OF DEMAND CURVE
A movement along a given demand curve is coursed by change in the price of the
commodity. An upwards movement is caused by an increase in prices while a
downwards movement is caused by a fall in prices. This can be shown as below.

A
movement from b to a is caused by a (rise) change in price prom p 1 to p 2 and a

movement form a to b is caused by a fall in prices from p 2 to p 1.

Note: as price falls from p 2 to p 1 , quantity demanded rises from Q 1 to Q 2.

A shift of the demand curve is caused by change in other factors influencing demand
other than price of the commodity. The impact of these other factors shall be observed
later.

A shift of the demand curve can either be to the right or left depending on the direction
on which a change has taken place. A shift to the right shows an increase in demand
while a shift to the left shows a decline in demand.

OTHER FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE DEMAND
price of other commodities which are related to the good in question:
There are two possible relations between the demand of one commodity and the price
of other commodity.
A fall in price of one commodity (X) may lower the quantity demanded of good Y,
the two commodities x and y, are said to be substitutes.
When prices of one commodity fall, the household buys more of it and less of
commodities that are substitutes for it.
Example:

a. Butter and Margarine
b. Sukuma wiki and Cabbage
c. Beef and Fish
If a fall in price of one commodity raises the quantity demanded of another commodity
the two are said to be complements.

When the price of one commodity falls, more of it is consumed and more of those
commodities that are complementary to it are consumed also. Example, motor cars and
petrol, butter and bread etc.

Graph 1 : curve sloped upwards indicating that as price of a substitute falls, the quantity

demanded of good x falls. So good y, and x, are substitutes.

Graph 2: curve slopes downwards, indicating that when the price of a complement falls

there is a rise in the quantity of good x demanded.

Consumer income
We would expect a rise in income to be associated with a rise in the quantity of a
good demanded. Goods obeying this rule are called normal goods. In some cases a
change in income might leave the quantity demanded completely unaffected. This
will be the case with goods for which desire is completely satisfied after a level of
income is obtained.
Example: if one used to eat salt, the consumption of it will not change even though
his income rises, unless his income is very low.
Incase of other commodities, rise of income beyond a certain level may lead to a fall
in the quantity that the household demand. If the demand for a commodity falls as
income rises, the good is called inferior good.
The relation between income and quantity demanded can be shown by the use of
Engels curve

The curve shows the relationship between income and demand, holding other factors
constant. Engel curve for normal good slopes upwards, implying that as income rises,
quantity demanded will also increase. Incase of inferior good, if Y increases Q
decreases. In this case the Engels curve will slope downwards from left to right.
The curve shows the relationship between income and demand, holding other factors

quantity demanded will also increase. Incase of inferior good, if Y increases Q
decreases. In this case the Engels curve will slope downwards from left to right.
DISTINCTION BETWEEN GIFFEN GOOD AND INFERIOR GOOD
Giffen good; relates to behavior of quantity demanded in relation to price.
Inferior good: relates to behavior of quantity demanded in relation to income.
Consumers tastes and preferences
When the tastes for a commodity are favorable, consumers will prefer more of that
commodity to other commodities thereby increasing the demand for the commodity.
For example, in the beauty, would the taste of women have moved towards colored
hair products such as pony tail or dyeing of hair. So the demand of such products
would hike.
Advertisement:
As a producer advertises his product, he creates awareness that his products exist, and
he tries to show the superiority of his product over others in the market. If we hold
Income Y
Quantity
demanded
0
other factors constant, we expect that an increase in advertisement expenditure will

lead to an increase in demand.

Advertising is

 Informative
 Persuasive on price, availability, performance.
 Consumers expectations about future prices:
If consumers expect the price of a commodity to rise in future, they will buy more of

the commodity now and store it. In this case quantity demanded increases. However,

should they expect a fall in price in future they will buy less on the commodity now

hoping to buy more in future after the price has fallen. In this case quantity demanded

becomes less.

 The size of population and its composition.
The greater the size of population to satisfy, the greater the quantity consumers will

be willing to demand. The fewer the consumer in the market, the less the quantity

demanded will be.

When we talk of composition of population we are talking of the sex proportion and

age group. Certain commodities are manufactured for certain age group and sex. For

instance, cosmetics are meant to be used by women, napkins by infants, shaving

cream by men. So producers consider these factors before deciding how much to

produce. Who shall be his target market?

SUPPLY
 Supply as a commodity is defined as the quantity of that commodity sellers are
willing to put in the market at a given price and at a given time.

 Supply should be distinguished from stock, whereas stock is the total quantity of a
commodity which is available at any specific time, supply is that part of stock which
is offered for sale at any price.

 For example, the supply of oil is not the estimated resources of all the world’s oil
fields, but only that amount which particular price will bring into the market.

 Supply will always change with price changes. This relationship between supply and
price is called the law of supply.

 The Law states that other things remaining constant, when price rises, supply
increases and when price falls, supply decreases.

Supply schedule.

Is defined as table showing quantities sellers are willing to put in the market at all
possible prices. This is shown below.

Price per unit Quantity

In the above diagram, it can be seen that the supply curve slopes upwards from left to
right showing that sellers are willing to supply more at higher prices and to supply less at
lower prices. It follows therefore that the supply curve for a normal good slopes upwards
from left to right.

Factors that influence supply

The price of the commodity
Objectives of the firm
The technology used
The cost of production incurred by producers
Taxation policies of the government
Weather condition
Subsidies
Price of competing products
Peace and stability
Infrastructure
Qs=f(p 0 ,p 1 ,tech OT,,, W,S)
The price of commodity
At higher prices products are motivated to produce more thereby increasing the
supply of the commodity under consideration. At lower prices less is supplied
because producers see no reason why they should produce more because profitability
will be negatively affected.
Objective of the firm
A firm can have various objectives. For example profit maximization; to maximize
profit will require that more be supplied at higher price. However, some welfare
organization doesn’t follow this law. For example, the supply of drugs; supply of
drugs may rise depending on the prevailing situation even though prices are low.
Technology used
If better methods of production are used, we again expect output to be economically
produced and so the supply of the commodity in question will increase. More can be
supplied at some price because per unit cost of production would be lower than in the
case where worse methods of production are used.
Cost of production
Increase in the cost of production will lower quantity supplied because producers will
find it very expensive to increase output. However, with low cost of production more
is likely to be supplied since the producer will find easy and cheaper ways of
producing more of the commodity in question.
Taxation policies of the government
The taxation policies of the government also influence quantity supplied because if
the government raises taxes, the cost of production goes up thereby reducing quantity
supplied. Taxes make commodities be more expensive than competing products e.g.
East African breweries has been urging the government to lower taxes on its products
so that they could compete well against the south African Breweries products.
Subsidies
When the government subsidizes the production of a given good, the supply of that
good also increases because the cost of production is reduced by the subsidies given.
Government may decide to incur part of the overall cost of production as a way of
motivating production of certain goods which otherwise would have been very
expensive to produce. Why South Africa goods compete effectively against other
counties’ goods is because of support in the form of subsidies the producers receive
from South Africa government.
Weather condition
This commonly affect agricultural produce. When weather condition are good, more
is produced and hence supplied and vice versa.
Price of competing products
 For example Kenyan beer Vs South African beer or Aerial soap Vs Omo
 Manufacturers of thee products from Kenya have been complaining of unfair
competition that has been posed by such imported products. Such
imported products have led to the collapse of many local industries. For
example, Mitumba (second hand cloths) whose prices are much lower than
locally produced cloths have led to many textile industries closing down.
 Recall also the closure of Bata Shoes Company of Limuru because of
competition from cheap imported shoes and Jua kali made shoes.
 This is a clear example of how prices of competing products would affect
supply.
Peace And Security
Development of infrastructure particularly transport and communication.
MOVEMENT ALONG A GIVEN SUPPLY CURVE AND SHIFT OF A
SUPPLY CURVE.
A movement along a given supply curve is caused by changes in the prices of the

commodity. An upward movement is caused by an increase in price while a downward

movement is caused by a fall in prices.

A movement from C to D is caused by a rise in price from p 1 to p 2 and a movement

from D to C is caused by a fall in price from p 2 to p 1.

 A shift of the supply curve is caused by change in other factors influencing supply
other than price of the commodity. A shift of the supply curve can either be to the
right or left depending on the direction on which a change has taken place. A shift to
the right shows an increase in supply while a shift to the left shows a decline in
supply

ABNORMAL SUPPLY CURVES
There are cases where the law of supply may fail to be obeyed, and more may be
supplied as prices fall and less as prices rises. A case at hand is the one of target
workers. The supply curve of labor for target workers is a downward sloping curve
showing that at higher wages rates, target workers are willing to work for less hours
while at low wage rates target workers are willing to work are willing to work for
more hours. This is because target workers normally set for themselves a target and

after achieving that target they don’t bother to go ahead with work. This is shown
below.
 Here it is assumed that out target workers has set themselves a target of sh. 20
everyday. At wage rate of sh. 2 per hour. He shall be willing to work for 10 hours in
order to get sh. 20 per day. When the wage rate is increased to sh. 4 per hour, he is
willing only to work for 5 hours in order to sustain his income of sh. 20 per day. As
the wage rate is increased further to sh. 10 per hour he reduces his working hours
further to 2 hours only. This gives us a downwards sloping supply curve of labor. The
higher the wage rate, the lesser will be the labor supplied and vice versa.
 One reason why this would be possible is that as wage rate increases, the laborer is
able to realize his target within a short time and the rest of his time is spent on leisure.

Summary
The lecture has captured the concept of demand and supply and the factors affecting them
respectively. It is worth noting that a movement along a given demand or the supply
curve is caused by changes in the prices of the commodity while a shift of the either the
demand supply curve is caused by change in other factors influencing demand or supply
other than price of the commodity
 The law of demand is defined as, “other things being equal, with a fall in price, the
demand for the commodity is extended (increases), and with a rise in the price, the
demand is contracted (decreased)”
 The Law of supply states that other things remaining constant, when price rises,
supply increases and when price falls, supply decreases.

EQUILIBRIUM/DISEQUILIBRIUM & ELASTICITIES OF
DEMAND AND SUPPLY
LECTURE OBJECTIVES
At the end of the lecture, the student should :

Describe the nature of market equilibrium/disequilibrium
Explain changes in market equilibrium/ disequilibrium
Understand the concept of price elasticity of demand (define, measure, interpret
and apply)
Explain the determinants of elasticity
EQUILIBRIUM
In studying equilibrium, our objective is to determine the market price and quantity and
try to identify the forces that influence such a price and quantity.
 Equilibrium can be defined as a state of rest. It is a situation whereby quantity

demanded (Qd) is equal to quantity supplied (Qs) i.e. Qd=Qs
 In this case, we say that the market is clearing and there are no economic forces
generated to change this point hence it is stable.
We determine this graphically by the interpretation point of the demand and supply
curves as below

In the above diagram it can be seen that the forces of demand and supply determine the
price in the market, i.e. a price at which both consumers and sellers are happy and where
quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. That price is known as the equilibrium
price.

 In the diagram, should the price be above the equilibrium price, forces of demand and
supply will work together and lower the price towards the equilibrium price until the
equilibrium price is reached. For example at p 1 consumers will only be willing to
buy 0 Q 1 from the market while sellers will by willing to supply 0 Q 2. In this case an
excess supply equals to QQ 21 will be created. Because of this excess supply, sellers
will have to reduce the price in an attempt to encourage consumers to buy more.

Prices will be reduced until peis reached where quantity demanded equals quantity
supplied.
 Should the price be below the equilibrium price (e.g. at p 2 ) again the forces of
demand and supply will work together to ensure peis restored. At p 2 suppliers are
willing to supply only Q 3 because they consider p 2 to be very low. On the other
hand, consumers will be willing to buy Q 4 since very many of them can afford to pay
p 2. In this case an excess demand (shortage) equal to QQ 43 will be created. Because
of shortages, consumers will compete among themselves for the little that is available
and because of this competition, prices will be pushed upwards towards pe until
eventually peis reached.
MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION OF EQUILIBRIUM
Demand function: Qd = 3550 − 266 p
Supply function: Qs= 1526 + 240 p
Question: determine the equilibrium market price and quantity.
Solution
At equilibrium Qd =Qs
Thus. 3550 − 266 p= 1526 + 240 p 4.

TYPES OF EQUILIBRIUM
Stable equilibrium
Unstable equilibrium
Neutral equilibrium
Stable equilibrium: if there is a force that disrupts the market equilibrium, then there
would be adjustments that bring back to the initial equilibrium. This type of equilibrium
is well explained in the previous section.
Unstable equilibrium: this occurs when the deviation from the equilibrium position tend
to push the market further away from the equilibrium conditions of unstable equilibrium
occurs when the demand curve is positively sloped as in the case of a giffen good or
when the supply curve is negatively sloped as in the case of labor supply.
Illustration using demand for a giffen good
 Equilibrium point is pQee
 If price increases from pe to p 1 , excess demand over supply is created as shown by
the quantity Q 2 −Q 1
 Because of excess demand prices will continue going up and for away from
equilibrium point, hence unstable equilibrium.
Neutral equilibrium:- this occurs when the initial equilibrium is disturbed and the forces
of disturbances lead to a new equilibrium point. It may occur due to shift of either
demand or supply curve, and through effects of taxes etc.
Effects of shifts of demand/supply curve on equilibrium
The equilibrium price will fall or increase depending on the direction in which the shift
have taken place.

 An increase in supply is represented by a shift to the right.

 Initial equilibrium price and output is pe and Qe, respectively

 At this initial price pe with an increase in supply means output increasing to Q 2

while demand remains Qe.
 Therefore we shall have excess supply.

 To encourage consumers to consume more of the good, adjustment will be such that

prices decline. Prices will continue to decline until a new equilibrium price p 1 is
realized.
 Therefore the new equilibrium prices and output will be pQ 11

 Notice, because of all in prices to p 1 , quantity demanded will increase from Qe to

Q 1.
Therefore we can conclude by saying that an increase in supply leads to low price
and to increase in quantity demanded

This is a situation where quantity demanded is not equal to quantity supplied. (Qd=Qs),

and the market does not clear. Hence both consumers and suppliers will have to change
their behavior.

Conditions for disequilibrium

i) Price restriction by government
Government from time to time control prices of different commodities through
maximum price policies and minimum price policies.
Maximum (ceiling) price policy
Most countries use them in apartment rentals. Here prices are set below
equilibrium price because sometimes the equilibrium price might be regarded as
being too high for the poor consumers to afford essential commodities. In an
effort to protect poor consumers from exploitation, the government fixes a

maximum (ceiling) price so that commodities that are regarded as essential can be
within easy reach of the poor consumer. This can be shown in the diagram below.
In the above diagram it can be seen that a maximum price p 1 has been set below, the

equilibrium price pe. As a result excess demand represented by QQ 21 is created since at

p 1 supplier is willing to supply only Q 1 while consumers are willing to buy Q 2.
However if the ceiling is above pe, say p 2 , it will serve no purpose since the equilibrium

pQee will still be maintained. At p 2 there will be excess supply and the producer would
be better off reducing the price to pe to reduce wastage as a result of over production.

Consequences of maximum price policy

Shortages can be created since demand will exceed supply.
Search time to find the appropriate good is increased since the supply is too small.
The government might be forced to ration the little that is available in order to ensure
that at least everybody gets something.
Activities like black marketing, smuggling and hoarding are likely to take place because
the price below equilibrium level might be regarded as too low by the producers
The level of investment is likely to be discouraged because of low business profit
private business will be getting very low profits to plough back into their business.
Due to low investment, there might be unemployment. i.e. very few jobs will be
created because there won’t be enough investment to stimulate growth of the
economy.
On the positive side we can say that the welfare of the consumer is likely to increase
since the consumer will be able to afford the prices in the market.
Minimum (floor) price policies

This happens eg for agricultural goods and wages/labor. Here price are set above the
equilibrium price, the reason being that the government might consider the equilibrium
price to be a very low to motivate producers to continue production effectively. Done in
order to encourage producers to produce more. The government sets a minimum price.
Minimum price are mainly found in the agricultural sector since the agricultural sector
often suffers from price fluctuation. Below is a diagram which illustrates the working of
minimum price policies.

In the diagram it can be seen that a result of fixing a minimum price (p 1 ) above the

equilibrium price (pe) excess supply QQ 21 is created since consumers are willing to be

buy Q 1 , while suppliers are willing to supply Q 2

In this case the government has to purchase the excess supply and either store it so that it
can be re-supplied during the period of shortage or export to the outside market on order
to earn the country foreign exchange.

Failure to meet production target as another condition to disequilibrium
Failure to meet production target especially in the agricultural sector due to
unfavorable climatic condition among other could lead to disequilibrium in the
market. Let

Let SP=SA. That is, owing to unfavorable climatic condition, supposing the producer

fails to meet his targeted production of SP and instead he realizes only SA. This would

imply that there would be shortage as demand would exceed supply (Qe>SA). Because

of this excess demand (shortage) the prices will move upwards. The consumers will be

willing to pay a price p 1 for SA units of output. This is shown as point V(pQ 11 ) along

the demand curve.

On the other hand, if SP<SA, this implies more production than planned, there would be

excess supply and prices would be pushed down wards below the equilibrium.

However, this situation of disequilibrium may not be permanent. Once conditions
improve, equilibrium may be attained. That would be in the long run.

Lagged responses as a cause of disequilibrium
 Suppose we assume that consumer income has increased. This will lead to the shift of

demand curve to the right from D 0 D 0 to D 1
 The effects will be the disturbance of equilibrium from pQee and creation of excess

demand over supply (Q 1 −Qe)
 This is so because it will take the producers time before the they produce enough to
meet this excess demand.

 Because of this short-term shortages prices will be pushed upwards towards p^2
 From the law of demand and supply we know that as price increase demand will
decline and supply increase.

 This will continue until a new equilibrium point is attained (pQ 22 )

 It should be noted that before this new equilibrium point was attained there was a lag.
This could be because of inferior technology that could not allow production to take
place on time to avoid shortage. Another reason could be imperfect knowledge about
the market conditions. If consumers could have perfect knowledge on alternative
sources of product such shortage could not arise.

How disequilibrium concept is applied

The disequilibrium concept can be applied on the cob- Web model.

THE COBWEB THEORY

This model is used to trace the path from disequilibrium to position of equilibrium. In our
previous discussion, we said that one cause of disequilibrium is lagged responses.

The cobweb model assumes that producers output plans are fulfilled but with a time lag.
That is, if a producer is a farmer, he cannot within the short-run increase his output just
because the market is offering very good prices.

This is so because of the nature of the products. The time between planting and
harvesting is long enough for risk and uncertainty to prevail.

Thus, producers are assumed to base their production decisions on the previous period’s
prices. However demand depends on the prevailing prices in the market.

Therefore, what is consumed presently is what must have been planted in the previous
period.

D f p
Where pt is price in the current year.

pt− 1 is price in the previous year.

The cobweb model always begins with a situation of disequilibrium in the market due to
unplanned variation in the supply.

The following diagram can be used to illustrate what the cobweb theory is all about.

 Suppose the prevailing price in the market is p 1 , quantity demanded will be Q 1.
 Farmers will base their production decision for period 2 on the price of period 1 (p 1 ).
 Therefore in period 2 farmers will produce outputQ 2.
 From the diagram, it can be seen that consumers are willing to buy that quantity at
p 2.
 If farmers base their production decision for the third period on the present price p 2 ,
they will cut down production to Q 3 because they consider the price to be too low.
 With this quantity in the market p 3 will be offered by the consumer.
 Again if farmers base their decision for the fourth period on the present price i.e. p 3 ,
they will produce Q 4 , but with Q 4 produced, consumers will be willing to pay only
p 4.
 This process goes on as shown in the diagram until eventually equilibrium price is
achieved.
 From the diagram, it can be seen that the fluctuation tend to converge towards the
equilibrium, hence, this situation is known as convergent or a situation of stable
equilibrium.
Just like we have convergent fluctuation we can also have divergent fluctuation.

From the same procedure as in figure a, fluctuation in price tend to become wider over
successive period. In other words, the fluctuation tends to run away from equilibrium
prices. Such a situation is known as divergent situation in that it diverges from the
equilibrium price. Such a situation is known as a divergent situation in that it diverges
from the equilibrium price. It has also been called by some economists a situation of
unstable equilibrium.
WEAKNESSES OF COBWEB THEORY
It assumes that products (former) are irrational and hence base their production
decision on the previous prices without thinking of price changes but this is rather
unrealistic because in reality farmers always think about changes in prices in the
future.
The theory also assumes that all the quantity produced is sold in the market but this is
also unrealistic because in the true sense some agricultural products are assumed for
subsistence needs while others are stored waiting for sale in the future when prices
are considered high.
It is thus clear from the previous discussion that the elasticity of demand depends not
only on the ratio of price to quantity demanded, but also on the slope of the demand
curve.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN POINT ELASTICITY AND ARC
ELASTICITY OF DEMAND.
There are two different ways of computing elasticity of demand.

Point elasticity
Point elasticity is the proportionate change in quantity demanded resulting from a
proportionate change in price at a particular point along the demand curve.
When calculating point elasticity, it is assumed that the slope of the demand function
is known.
From the formula for elasticity,

Arc elasticity is a measure of the average elasticity; i.e. the elasticity at the mid point of
the chord that connects 2 points (A and B) along the demand curve defined by the initial
and the new price levels.

Using example in above demand schedule, assume initial price p 1 = 5 , which then

 Income elasticity of demand for most commodities is positive, indicating higher
purchases at higher income. Income elasticity for a few commodities is known as
inferior goods.
 Degree of income elasticity varies in accordance with the nature of commodities
consumers consume in general. Where the commodity id a basic necessity, the
demand is not very responsive to change in income. Basic necessities like food are
usually bought in fairly constant amount and on regular basis. In this case EY< 1
 However, in the case of luxuries, the demand is very responsive to change in income.
Sales of such goods increase rapidly with increase in income. In this case EY > 1
Cross elasticity of Demand
 The demand for one product can be influenced by the demand. For example, the
demand for beef depends on the demand for pork, mutton and fish etc. if the price of
beef rises while prices of substitutes (pork, mutton and fish) remains unchanged,
consumers will substitute beef with the cheaper product.
 In some cases, an increase in price of one product can lead to s reduction in demand
for other products. This is true of complementary products e.g. electricity and
electronic gadget, petrol to automobile etc. in this case the products are considered to
be complementary or used together rather the substitutes.
 Therefore, cross elasticity is the percentage change in quantity demanded of good x
due to 1 % change in the price of good Y it measures the degree of responsiveness of

demand for one product to changes of the price of its substitutes or complementary
goods
 For instance, cross elasticity of demand for tea (T) is the percentage change in its
quantity demanded with respect to one (1) percent change in price of its substitute
coffee (C).

Cross elasticity of demand can either be positive or negative.

 A high positive cross elasticity means that the commodities are cross substitutes. If
price of butter increases, the price of its substitutes (margarine) held constant, the
quantity demanded of margarines would increase.

 A negative cross elasticity means that the goods are complementary in the market,
thus a decrease in the price of one stimulates the sale of the other.

 A cross elasticity of zero means that the goods are independent of each other in the
market.

DETERMINANTS OF PRICE-ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
The following are the main determinants of price elasticity of demand.

 Availability of close substitutes to the commodity.

 Nature of a commodity

 Proportion of income which consumers spend on a particular commodity.

 Range of uses of a commodity.

 Habits

Availabity of close substitutes-The higher the degree of the closeness of the
substitutes, the greater the elasticity of demand of the good or service. For instance,
coffee and tea may be considered as close substitute for each other. Therefore, 1
percent increase in price of say coffee, would lead to more than proportionate decline
in quantity demanded of coffee.
Nature of a commodity-Demand for luxury goods (e.g. refrigerator, TV etc) is
more elastic because their consumption can be dispersed with or postponed when
their prices rise. On the other hand, consumption of necessities (e.g. foodstuffs),
essential for life, cannot be postponed and so their demand is inelastic.
Proportion of income which consumers spend on a particular commodity-If
proportion of income spent on a commodity is large, its demand will be more elastic,
and vice versa. A classic example of such commodities is salt, which claims a very
small proportion of income whereas clothes and other durable consumer goods claim
a large proportion of income.
Range of uses of a commodity- The wider the range of uses of a product, the higher
the elasticity of demand. As the price of a multi-use commodity decreases, people
extend their consumption to its other uses, thereby increasing the demand. For
instance, milk can be taken as it is, it may be converted into cheese, ghee and butter.
The demand for milk will therefore be highly elastic.
Habit: some goods are consumed because of habit e.g. smoking; in this case we find
that price changes leave quantity demanded more or less unaffected. In this case their
demand is said to inelastic.
Elasticity of supply

 This is the percentage change in the quantity supplied of a commodity resulting from
a 1% change in price.

 Elasticity of supply is usually positive because a higher price gives producers an
incentive to increase output.

 Like elasticity of demand, elasticity of supply can also be referred with respect to
such variables as interest rates, wage rates, price of raw materials and other
intermediate goods etc.

 Symbolically, elasticity of supply ( Esp ) can be expressed as follows.

Q
p

Q
Esp s⋅
∂
∂
=
 When a small change in price bring about a very big change in quantity supplied, then
we say that quantity supplied is elastic. On the other hand, if a big change in price
brings about a small change in quantity supplied, then we say that supply is inelastic.

Determinants of elasticity of supply

Availability of factors of productivity
This can be looked at as the ease with which factors of production could be shifted
from one use to another.It can also be looked at as the number of available resources.
When factors of production are available, supply will highly be elastic and vice versa.
Suppliers will be able to meet demand in good times.
Excess capacity of unsold stock (Buffer-stock)
if there exist a lot of stock, incase prices increase, supplier would be able to respond
very fast by increasing supply. In such a case supply is said to be highly elastic.
Time factor
This refers to the time it takes to produce and supply a product in the market. In the
short run, supply of most items that take a long time to produce is inelastic. But, in
the long run supply is inelastic.
Nature of a commodity
Durable/ stockable commodities such as clothes etc. have greater elasticity of supply
than perishable goods such as milk. This is so because, incase the price of perishable
items is low, producers will still be forced to supply the items because they cannot be
stored for future sale when the prices would increase.
Usefulness of the concept of elasticity
Useful in taxation.
If it is the aim of the government to raise revenue it has to put into consideration
elasticities of the commodities to be taxed, especially price elasticity of demand.
In order to raise revenue the government has to impose heavy taxes on goods which
have inelastic demand e.g. cigarettes and beer. This is because after taxes are imposed
on such goods consumers will continue to demand the goods in large quantities as
before and therefore the government is able to collect more revenue.
On top of this, the burden of taxes on goods which have inelastic demand falls more
on consumers because sellers are able to pass a greater part of the tax to the
consumers through high prices.
This leaves the production of such goods more or less un affected thus making it
possible for the government to raise enough revenue.
This is shown in the diagram below.
The original equilibrium price before the imposition of tax was p 0 and the new
equilibrium price after tax is p 1.
Distance AC on the diagram represents the tax imposed on the good.
AB of the tax is met by the consumers.
It can be seen from the diagram that the quantity in the market fell by a small proportion
QQ 01
It can thus be said that when a commodity has inelastic demand it pays the government to
tax that commodity heavily because the greatest part of the tax is met by consumers, thus
leaving the production of that good more or less unaffected, hence enabling the
government to collect more revenue from that good.
Elasticity is important in international trade
Before a country devalues her currency so as to encourage export and discourage imports,
it has to put into consideration the elasticity of demand and supply for her export and
imports.
For devaluation to succeed, exports must be highly elastic so that after devaluation,
greater quantities can be sold in the foreign market. Similarly, the export must have
elastic supply in order to meet increased demand in foreign markets.
On the import side, imports must have elastic demand so that after devaluation greater
quantities of imports can be abandoned.

We can therefore say that before any country devalues her currency, it is important to
consider elasticity of demand and supply for export and imports.
Elasticity also tells us the degree to which goods are related.
High cross elasticity between two commodities shows that the two commodities are very
related. This is a useful concept especially for formulating pricing strategies. Such
elasticity is especially important in studying how unfair competition of dumped goods
affects performance of domestic industries. This would thus enable the government know
how much import duty to impose on such goods as to protect local industries from
collapsing.
The cobweb theory model is used to trace the path form disequilibrium to position of
equilibrium.
The concept of elasticity is useful in various ways namely:
♣ The relation of the goods
♣ Taxation.
♣ international trade
♣ Elasticity is the percentage change in the quantity supplied/demanded of a
commodity resulting from a 1% change in price.
THE CARDINALIST THEORY OF CONSUMER
BEHAVIOR
At the end of the lecture, the students should:

Understand the concept of utility.
Derive of the equilibrium condition and the demand curve for the consumer.
Understand the critique of the cardinalist approach
The cardianalist argue that utility can be measured. Some economists have suggested

that where perfect knowledge of market condition and income level exist, utility can be

measured in monetary units, by the amount of money the consumer is willing to pay

(sacrifice) for another unit of a commodity. Others suggested the measurement of utility

in subjective units called utils. (Subjective – depending on personal judgment/

imagination)

The cardinal utility theory

Cardinal approach could also be referred to as utility approach.

Concept of utility

Utility can be defined as satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming various goods and

services. Utility here is assumed to be quantifiable (measurable)

It is very important to distinguish between total utility and marginal utility.

Total utility:- refers to the entire amount of satisfaction a consumer receives from

consuming various goods. Given that consumers consume different types of goods, say

x 1 ...xn, total utility is U= (xf 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ,...,xn) The more of an item a consumer consumes
per unit of time, the greater will be the total utility up to a certain point. When this point

is reached, the commodity will no longer give the consumer any utility. Such a point is

known as saturation point.

Marginal utility: - is the change in total utility resulting from a unit change in quantity

of a given commodity consumed.

Under normal circumstances marginal utility fall as more additional units are consumed.

The following two figures show total utility and marginal utility curve, representative

To be able to draw the two diagrams we have assumed that total utility is derived from
commodity x.

From fig. (a), total utility increased but at a decreasing rate, up to a quantity x, and then
start decline.

From fig. (b), the marginal utility of commodity x may be depicted by a line with a
negative slope. Marginal utility of x declines continuously and become zero at quantity x,
and become negative beyond quantity x.

This leads us to the law of diminishing marginal utility which states that, as more

quantities are consumed of a particular good, satisfaction derived from additional units

goes on falling.

ASSUMPTIONS (AXIOM) MADE UNDER CARDINAL APPROACH

Axiom- statement that is accepted as true without further proof or argument

Rationality:- the consumer is rational and aims at maximizing his utility subject to
the constraint imposed by his income level.
Cardinal utility :- utility of each commodity is measurable conveniently in monetary
units by the amount of money the consumer is willing to pay for extra unit of
commodity.
Constant marginal utility of money :- this assumption is necessary if the monetary
unit is used as the measure of utility. The essential features of a standard unit of
measurement are that it be constant. If marginal utility of money changes as income

increases (or decreases) the measuring- rod for utility becomes inappropriate for
measurement.
Diminishing marginal utility:- this means that utility gained from larger/additional
quantities of a commodity declines.
Total utility depends on the quantities of the individual commodities (x 1 ,x 2 ,...,xn)the
t make up the basket of goods. Hence, total utility (U= (xf 1 ,x 2 ,...,xn))
Derivation of the equilibrium condition for the consumer

 Consumer is said to be at equilibrium when he maximizes his utility.

 To derive the condition for utility maximization we start by considering a simple
model of a single commodity x.

U= (qf x) Here qx means quantity of x.
 The consumer can either buy x or retain his money Y.

 If the consumer buys qx, his expenditure will be px⋅qx

 Since utility is measured in monetary units, the consumer seeks to maximize the
difference between his utility (U) and expenditure (px⋅qx)

i.e. U−px⋅qx
 The necessary condition for a maximum is that the partial derivative of the function
with respect to qx be equal to zero.

 Equation (i) defines the equilibrium condition for the consumer and it states that the

 Thus, if MU >px, the consumer can increase his welfare by purchasing more units

of x. notice, owing to law of diminishing marginal utility, as he consumes more of x,
MU x<px, the consumer can increase his total satisfaction by reducing quantity of x
purchased, hence keeping more income unspent.

DERIVATION OF THE DEMAND CURVE FOR THE CONSUMER
The derivation of demand is based on the axiom of diminishing marginal utility.
In our earlier discussion we saw that marginal utility of say commodity x may be
depicted by a line with a negative slope.
 From Fig a, marginal utility of x declines continuously and becomes negative beyond
quantity x.
 If the marginal utility is measured in monetary units, the demand curve for x is
identical to the positive segment of the marginal utility curve.
 At equilibrium, MU x=px
 Hence, at x 1 , MU is MU 1. This is equal to p 1 in diagram (b)

 Hence at p 1 the consumers demand x 1 quantity

 Thus, diagram b gives the demand curve for consumer, and it is defined by the
positive segment of the marginal utility curve in figure a.

 The negative section of the MU curve does not form part of the demand curve, since
negative quantities do not make sense in economics.

CRITIQUE OF THE CARDINAL APPROACH

Utility cannot be measured objectively. The attempt by an economist called
Walras to use subjective units (utils) for utility measurement doesn’t give
satisfactory solution.
The assumption of constant utility for money is also unrealistic. As income
increases the marginal utility of money changes. Thus, money cannot be used as a
measuring-rod since its own utility changes.
The axiom of diminishing marginal utility is a psychological law that is a feeling
that cannot be quantified.
In summary, it is clear that, the cardianalist theory of consumer behavior argues that
utility can be measured. The derivation of demand is based on the axiom of diminishing
marginal utility. The equilibrium condition for the consumer and it states that the
marginal utility of x is equated to market price of x.
 Law of diminishing marginal utility which states that, as more quantities are
consumed of a particular good, satisfaction derived from additional units goes on
falling

 Consumer is said to be at equilibrium when he maximizes his utility
THE ORDINALIST THEORY OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
At the end of the lecture, the learner should:

Understand the indifference curve theory.
Determine the equilibrium of the consumer using the Indifference curve approach.
Understand the concept of the budget constraint of the consumer.
Derive the demand curve using the I.C approach.
Derive the Engels curve

THE INDIFFERENCE – CURVE THEORY
ASSUMPTIONS

Rationality:- consumer is assumed to be a utility maximizer, given his income
and market prices. So, he will choose a combination of goods that maximize his
utility.
Utility of ordinal:- the consumer is able to rank his preference (order the various
baskets of goods) according to the satisfaction of each basket. Therefore the
consumer need not measure utility to make his choices.
Consistency of choice:- it is assumed that the consumer is consistent in his
choice, that is, if in one period he prefers bundle A to B, he will not choose B
over A in another period. If both bundles are available to him. The consistency
assumption may be symbolically written as follows:
Transitivity of choice:- if bundle A is preferred to B, and B is preferred to C,
then bundle A, is preferred to C.
That
is if A>B
and B>C
then A>C
Installation axiom (not getting satisfied):- consumer will prefer a combination of
goods that has more units than that with less units. For example.
combination orange Mangoes
A 10 6
B 11 6
C 12 7
The consumer will prefer combination C because it has the highest number of oranges
and mangoes.
Total utility for the consumer depends on the quantity of the commodities consumed.
i.e. U= (qf 1 ,q 2 ,...,qx,qy,qn)
Diminishing marginal rate of substitution:-
Marginal rate of substitution refers to the slope of indifference curve. it measures how
much of say good x, must a consumer give up in order to consume an additional unit
of good y, holding utility constant (while still achieving the same level of satisfaction)
as shall be seen in the discussion that follows, indifference curves are assumed to be
convex to the origin, implying that their slopes decreases (in absolute terms) as we
move along the curves from the left downwards to the right. Diminishing MRS
simply means that, it becomes increasingly difficult to substitute x for y as we move
along the indifference curve.
EQUILIBRIUM OF THE CONSUMER
Equilibrium of the consumer refers to the choice of the bundle of goods that
maximize utility. To obtain this, we introduce the concept of indifference curves and
of their slope (the Marginal rate of substitution), and the concept of the budget line.
Indifference curve
An indifference curve can be defined as a curve that joins combinations of two
commodities which yield the same level of satisfaction (utility) to the consumer.
Along the indifference curve utility is constant (U) whether he consumes at point A, B,
or C. so consumer is indifference about the different combinations.

Indifference map
An indifference map shows all the indifference curves which rank the preference of the
consumer.
 Combinations of goods lying on a higher indifference curve (as III) yields higher level of
satisfaction and are preferred to those on lower indifference curves (as I) which yield
lower utility.

 In figure 1 it can be observed that the consumer must give up consuming some units of y
if he must consume more units of x, while still realizing same utility level. That is, if he is
at point A where he is consuming y, units of y and x 1 units of x, to consume x 3 , he will
reduce the consumption of y to y 3 (by yy 31 )

However, the indifference curve is assumed to be convex to the origin. This is a clear
indication that, although commodities y and x could be substituted for each other, but this
would only be to certain extent. Good x and y are not perfect substitutes
 Marginal rate of substitution of x for y is defined as the number of units of commodity

y that must be given up in exchange for an extra unit of commodity x so that the
consumer maintains the same level of satisfaction.
It is given by the negative of the slope of an indifference curve at any point along the
indifference curve

PROPERTIES OF THE INDIFFRENCE CURVE

An indifference curve has a negative slope, which denotes that if the quantities of one
commodity (y) decreases, the quantity of the other (x) must increase, if the consumer
is to stay on the same level of satisfaction.
The further away from the origin an indifference curve lies, the higher the level of
utility it denotes and the bundles of goods it represents are preferred by the rational
consumer.
Indifference curves do not intersect.
If indifference curve U 1 and U 2 intersect, it would mean that at point p, we could
have two different levels of satisfaction, which is impossible. Point p has same
satisfaction as point A since they both lie on the same indifference curve U 1 .Also
note that to the left of point p, indifferent curve U 1 is above U 2 , and to the right it is
the opposite case. Thus ranking of bundle of goods would be ambiguous.
Indifference curves are convex to the origin, implying that their slope decreases (in
absolute terms) as we move down from left to right.
This property is in line with the assumption of diminishing marginal rate of
substitution. The number of units of y the consumer is willing to sacrifice in order to
obtain an additional unit of x decreases as the quantity of x increases.

Notice as we move down the indifference curve, e.g. initially from x 1 to x 2 we give up a

big margin (“a”) of y.

As we continue downwards, consumer continue to reduce the amount of y he would be
willing to give up for x. that is why consumer continue to give up lesser quantities of y as
he moves downwards the indifference curve.

That is, it becomes increasingly difficult to substitute one commodity for another as we
move along the indifference curve.

Note:

If x and y are perfect substitutes, the indifference curve becomes a straight line with
negative slope.

 At point A consumer can only consume y and zero units of x

 At point B, he consumes only x.

 This situation of consumer only consuming one type of good alone (monomalia
situation) is unrealistic in real world situation, and one usually ruled out from the
analysis of the behavior of the consumer.

THE BUDGET CONSTRAINT (LINE) OF THE CONSUMER

 A budget line can be defined as a line that joins all combinations of two commodities
a consumer can buy using his entire income.

 It is assumed that consumers’ income is fixed, say at I, and he tries to allocate this
income between two commodities x and y.

 How many of the two commodities to consume would depend on the prices of each.

 Assume price of commodity x is pxand of commodity y is py.

 If qx units of commodity x is consumed and qyunits of commodity y.

 The income constraint, in the case of two commodities, may be written.

 The consumer can only operate in the shaded area called budget space which gives a
set of all commodity bundle that may be purchased by spending some or whole of a
given income level.

Changes in the budget line.

 It is important to note that changes in price of commodities concerned and changes in
income level affect the budget line.

 From the figure presented above, combination D and E give a consumer less

satisfaction because they are on a lower indifference curve, even though the
combination lie on the budget line and are affordable.
 Although combination A,B and C give higher satisfaction to the consumer than D and

E. the consumer cannot afford B and C due to his limited income. Notice point B and
C lie above the budget line.

 However the condition of tangency between the two curves is the first condition that

must be fulfilled for the consumer to be in equilibrium. But, this condition alone is
only a necessary but not sufficient condition for equilibrium.
 The second condition to be fulfilled is that the indifference curve be convex to the

origin. This condition is fulfilled by the axiom of diminishing marginal rate of
substitution of x for y, which states that the slope of the indifference curve decreases.
(in absolute terms) as we move along the curve from the left downwards to the right.
 Since the two conditions are fulfilled, the consumer maximizes his utility by buying

x* and y* units of the two commodities.
DERIVATION OF DEMAND CURVE USING THE INDIFFERENCE CURVE
APPROACH
Graphical derivation of the demand curve.
 Suppose the price of commodity x falls, with price of commodity y and income level

(I) remaining unchanged.
 The budget line will tilt outwards to the right from AB to AB ' to AB '' as shown

below.
 It can be noted that as price of commodity x falls from px 1 to px 2 to px 3 , more of
good x is consumed because it becomes cheaper.
 The real income or purchasing power of income increases thus leading consumer to
consume more of commodity y too. (see figure A)
 As can be observed also in figure A, the new budget lines associated with decreased
prices are tangent to higher indifference curves (e.g. AB 'is tangent to indifference
curve II, and AB ''to indifference curve III.
 The new equilibrium occurs to the right of the original equilibrium (for normal
goods) showing that as prices falls more of the commodity will be bought.

 The line joining equilibrium points e 1 , e 2 and e 3 is called Price Consumption

Line/Curve (PCC).
 From the PCC line, we can derive the demand curve for commodity x.

 It has been observed that ;

At point e 1 the consumer buys quantity x 1 at price px 1.
At point e 2 the price px 2 is lower than px 1 and the quantity demanded has increased
to x 2 and so on.
 This relationship between price and quantity shown in figure B to obtain a demand
curve.

 The demand curve in figure B is downwards slopping, thus obeying the law of
demand which states that, quantity bought increases as the price falls.

Engels curve
 Same approach could be used to derive the angels curve. recall from earlier

discussion on demand that angels curve shows relationship between income and
quantity of goods consumed.
 First consider that income increases prices of commodities x and y remaining

unchanged.
 Constant increase in income causes budget line to shift to the right from AB to A'B'

to A B'.'''
Notice increase in income will lead to increase in consumption of both good x and y

 The ICC shows equilibrium combinations of x and y consumed at various levels of
income, with prices remaining constant.
 From fig c it can be observed that associated with higher income I 1 ,I 2 ,I 3 is higher
levels of consumption x 1 ,x 2 and x 3.
 If we plot relationship between I and x, we obtain engels curve, which is positively
sloped.
 In our discussion of demand, it was observed that for normal goods, engels curve will
be positively sloped, and vice versa for inferior goods.

INCOME AND SUBSTITUTION EFFECT OF A PRICE CHANGE
CASE 1: substitution and income effects for normal good in case of a price rise
 We start by assuming that the consumer is at equilibrium at point p on indifference
curve II purchasing units of x.

 Supposing the price of commodity x rises, the price of good y and money income

remaining constant, the budget line will tilt inwards from LM to LM 1.
 The consumer will move to a new equilibrium position at R on indifference curve I. at

this point quantity demanded decreases from Ox 1 to Ox 3
 The overall changes in quantity demanded from equilibrium position p to R is
referred to as the total effect of a price change.

 The total effect is negative because quantity demanded is reduced from Ox 1 to Ox 3 as

price rises.
 The total effect of a price change can be split into two effects.

(i) Substitution effect
(ii) Income effect
 In this example, whenever the price of x rises with price of y and money income
remaining constant, two things happen.

(i) The consumer may be induced to substitute y for x because x is relatively
expensive., so as to attain same level of satisfaction as before a price increase.

The opposite would take place incase of a fall in price of x. this is called
substitution effect of price change.
The increase in price of x (money income remaining constant) cause the consumer’s real
income to decrease. The size of the bundle of goods and services a consumer can buy
declines. He will thus be unable to consume more of x or y. the consumer’s level of
satisfaction must decline. The change in quantity demanded resulting exclusively from a
change in real income, price of y and money income held constant is what is referred to
as income effect of price changes.

SUBSTITUTION EFFECT

 From the figure as price of commodity x increases, the consumers real income
declines. That is, level of satisfaction declines, as indicated by the movement from
indifference curve II to indifference curve I.

 For the consumer to attain same level of satisfaction a s before an increase in the price
of x, and a decline in real income, he must be given an additional money income just
sufficient to compensate him for the loss in real income. That is, the consumer is
given a compensatory payment just sufficient to remain on indifference curve II
under new price regime.

 Since budget line LM 1 represent the new price regime, the compensatory payment is

graphically shown by constructing a fictitious budget line tangent to the original
indifference curve, but whose slope corresponds to the new price ratio.
 Line CC is the fictitious budget line, and it is tangent to the original indifference
curve II at point Q. note also that CC is parallel to the new budget line LM 1 thereby
reflecting the new price ratio.

 The substitution effect is represented by the movement from the original equilibrium
position at P, to the imaginary equilibrium position at Q both points being situated on
the original indifference curve. in terms of quantity, the substitution effect is the
reduction in quantity demanded from Ox 1 to Ox 2 or by xx 21 units.

 Movement along same indifference curve simply shows that, consumers attempt to
substitute away from the relatively expensive good to the cheaper one.

 If we were to explain the substitution effect when the price of x declines, we would
assume that the consumer is compensated by decreasing his money income by an
amount just sufficient to maintain real income constant at the new price ratio.

INCOME EFFECT
 In determining the substitution effect, one is constrained to movement along the
original indifference curve.
 However, the total effect of a price change money income and the prices of other
commodities held constant, always entails a shift from one indifference curve to
another, or a change in real income.
 If consumers real income is to fall from the level represented by the fictitious budget
line CC, the movement from the imaginary equilibrium position Q on indifference

curve II to the actual new equilibrium R on indifference curve I indicates the income
effect.
 Note that since CC and LM 1 are parallel, the movement doesn’t involve a change in
the relative prices, it is a real income phenomenon.
 The reduction in quantity demanded from Ox 2 to Ox 3 measures change in quantity
demanded attributable exclusively to the decline in real income, the change in relative
price already having been accounted for by the substitution effect.
 In conclusion the total effect of a price change is the sum of the substitution and
income effect.
Total effect = SE +IE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUBSTITUTION AND INCOME EFFECT IN THE
CASE OF NORMAL, INFERIOR AND GIFFEN GOODS
CASE1: NORMAL GOOD
For normal good the income effect reinforces the substitution effect.
↓p→↑ real income →↑ Qd income effect
↓p→↑ Qd because of substitution effect.
So both effects move in the same direction for normal good quantity demanded always
varies inversely with hike.
CASE 2: INFERIOR GOOD
An inferior good is one for which the quantity demanded varies inversely with real
income.
↑real income →↓ Qd
The substitution and income effect in this case will move in the opposite directions.
An income effect will be less than the substitution effect of a price change.

 As price of inferior good declines, budget line LM will tilt outwards to LM 1. The

new equilibrium point becomes point R on indifference curve II.
 Total effect of price change is Ox 3 −Ox 1 = xx 31. Because the consumers real income

has increased, we compensate him by decreasing his money income so that he
remains on original indifference curve I. The decrease in money income is shown by
drawing an imaginary budget line CC, which has same price ratio as LM 1 and which
is parallel to the budget line.
 The substitution effect is represented by the movement from point p to Q along the
same indifference curve. a fall in price of x causes the consumer to increase his
consumption of the cheaper commodity x and reduce the consumption of commodity.

 Thus substitution effect associated with the fall in px is positive (Ox 2 −Ox 1 > 0 )

 As a result of fall in price of good x, real income of consumer increases. The
movements from the imaginary equilibrium position Q on indifference curve I to
actual new equilibrium R on indifference curve II indicate income effect.

 For inferior goods, an increase in real income leads to a fall in quantity demanded

from Ox 3 to Ox 2.
 Notice income effect associated with the fall in pxis negative (Ox 3 −Ox 2 < 0 )

 Since SE >IE , it will offset the negative income effect. So net effect of a price

decline will be positive Ox 3 −Ox 1 = xx 21 > 0
(Total effect = SE+IE = (Ox 2 −Ox 1 )+(Ox 3 −Ox 2 )=(Ox 3 −Ox 1 )> 0 )

 So price and quantity demanded will be inversely related in the case of inferior goods.

CASE 3: GIFFEN GOODS

Quantity demanded increase with increase in price and vice versa.

For giffen goods the income effect is so strong that it moves then offsets substitution

 Substitution effect = (Ox 2 −Ox 1 = xx 21 > 0 ) it is movement from P to Q.

 Income effect = (Ox 3 −Ox 2 = xx 32 < 0 ) it is not only negative but large enough to

offset positive substitution effect.
 Total effect = SE+IE = (Ox 2 −Ox 1 )+(Ox 3 −Ox 2 )=Ox 3 −Ox 1 = xx 13 < 0

 Thus in the case of giffen good the law of demand wont hold. A decrease in price
leads to a decrease in quantity demanded. Thus demand curve will be positively
sloped.

THE CONSUMER SURPLUS

 It was introduced by Marshall. It is defined as the difference between the actual
market price and any price above the market price consumers will be willing to pay
for a given commodity rather than do without it

Summary
The indifference curve indicates the various combinations of two goods which yield
equal satisfaction to the consumer. By definition, an indifference curve shows all the
various combinations of two goods that give an equal amount of satisfaction to a
consumer. the ordinalist view that it is wrong to base the theory of consumption on two
assumptions; (i) that there is only one commodity which a person will buy at one time,
and (ii) the utility can be measured.

Be able to use the concept of the returns to scale.
Determine the equilibrium of the firm.
Introduction

In the previous topics we looked at the demand side of the market. We analyzed how

consumers decide on combination of goods and services to consume so as to maximize

their level of satisfaction. We now switch over to the supply side of the market. In this

topic we look at the most efficient and least costly way of producing goods and services.

We start by looking at the at the theory of production, then the theory of costs.

THE PRODUCTION THEORY
Definition of production concept

(i) Production:- this is the creation of goods and services through the transformation
of inputs into outputs.

(ii) Inputs:- these are the ingredients used by a firm to produce a good or service.
Sometimes they are called factors of production or resources. These include land,
capital, labour, entrepreneurs etc.

(iii) Output:- this is the end product of transforming input into goods or services.
Output is thus a function of the various input expressed in the production
function.

(iv) Production function:- a production function is a schedule (or table, or
mathematical equation) showing the maximum amount of output that can be
produced from any specified combination of inputs, given the existing
technology.
In short the production function is like a “recipe book” showing what output are
associated with which combination of inputs.
It may be represented as follows

Q=f(K ,, rL )
Where :
Q is output
L is labour
K is capital
r are other input resources
(v) Short run period:- refers to the period of time during which it is impractical
to change the employment levels of some inputs so as to immediately increase
output.
Factors input that cannot be varied during this period are referred to as fixed
input incase an immediate change in output is desired, it would be extremely
costly to immediately vary such inputs. Such inputs include buildings,
machinery, managerial personnel. Therefore changes in output must be
accomplished exclusively by changes in the usage of variable inputs. A
variable input:- is one whose quantity may be changed almost
instantaneously in response to desired changes in output. Many types of
labour services and the inputs of raw and processed materials fall in this
category. Thus in short run period one factor is held fixed (e.g. capital) while
other one variable (labour)
(vi) Long run period:- is defined as that period of time in which inputs are
variable in the long run it may be economical to install additional productive
facilities. In order to produce a certain level of output, we could use different
combinations of labour and capital.
(vii) Isoquant:- is a curve that shows all the combinations of inputs that will
produce a certain level of output, given same level of technology.
In the analysis of theory of production two approaches will be used.

1. Analysis of production: in the short run when one factor is variable
   and the other is fixed. (short run period function approach)
2. Isoquant analysis, which is long-run approach and which assumes
   that all factors are variable.
   SIMILARITY AND DIFFRENCES BETWEEN CONSUMER
   BEHAVIOR & PRODUCTION THEORY
   Objectives:- the consumer aims at maximizing utility while producer aims at maximizing
   output.

Constraint:- the consumer is constrained by the income level and prices of commodities
while the producer is constrained by technology level and the cost of inputs.

Tools of analysis:- the analysis of consumer behavior employs indifference curves, while
that of the production theory employs isoquant.

TYPES OF PRODUCTION CURVES

Here distinction is made between three types of production curves.

1. Total product curve
2. Marginal product curve
3. Average product curve
   Total Product (TP)
   In the short run, production function gives the total (maximum) output obtainable
   from different amounts of the variable inputs, given a specified amount of the fixed
   input.
   In the short-run, production function is written as Q= f(K,L), where capital is fixed
   and labour is variable.
   Average Product (AP) or Average Physical Product (APP)
   The average product of an input is that product divided by the amount of the input
   used to produce this output.
   ( )
   L
   f K L

   = =
   This can be read as average product of the variable input labour.
   Marginal Physical Product (MPP or MP)
   Is the change in total product that results from one unit change in the amount of
   variable inputs (e.g. labour), the fixed input remaining unchanged. (may also say,
   other inputs other than labour remaining unchanged)
   Therefore marginal product of labour is the derivative of output with respect to
   labour.

This is a short run case whereby not all inputs are variable. Labour (L) is variable, while
capital is fixed at 1 unit.

TP Curve

From the table and figure, total output increases with more employment of labour,
reaches a maximum at Qx= 119 , and number of labour employed equal 8. as more and

more laborers are employed beyond 8, output starts to decline.

MP Curve

As more laborers are employed, marginal product of labour increases, reaching

maximum at L= 4 , then declines reaching zero, when L= 8 beyond L= 8 , MP L

becomes negative

AP Curve

Average product curve also increases initially as L increases, reaching maximum at

L= 6 then start declining. AP L remain positive as long as total product is positive.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TP & MP

As long as MP L is increasing, TP will continue to raise at an increasing rate. This is
the case as labour increases up to 4.

Beyond L= 4 up to L= 8 ,MP L starts to decline although it is still positive. TP
continues to increase but at a diminishing rate.
When MPL reaches zero, TP reaches its maximum. At this point TP = 119 while
L= 8.
When MP L becomes negative, TP will start declining so any employment beyond
L= 8 yield negative MP.
 This bring us to the law of diminishing returns which states that:-

 If more and more units of a variable input (in our case labour) are applied to a given
quantity of fixed input, the total output may initially increase at an increasing rate, but
beyond a certain level of output, the rate of increase in the total output diminishes.

The reason behind the operation of this law is that with increasing units of labour to a
fixed factor (say capital) each additional worker has less and less tools and equipment to
work with. Consequently, the productivity of the marginal worker eventually decreases.
As a result, the total product increases at a diminishing rate beyond a point.

 For the law to hold the following two condition must be fulfilled.

1. Some input(s) must remain fixed as the amount of the input in question, say
   labour is varied.
2. Technology must remain unchanged, since a change in technical know-how
   would cause the entire TP curve to shift. An upwards shift in TP curve reflects a
   change to superior technology while a downwards shift reflects a change to
   inferior technology relative to existing one.

THE THREE STAGES OF PRODUCTION
Using figure 1 above, we can identify three stages of production.

Stage I:

 Marginal product continues to increase making total product increase at an increasing
rate. Marginal product reaches maximum at L= 4

 It is a stage of increasing returns because output increases as you increases the use of
the variable factor (Labour). Here fixed factors (capital) is under utilized. That is why
as more and more workers are added utilization of machine increases and productivity
of additional workers increases. At this stage it would be inefficient for firms to
operate since there is still room for increased output and hence high profit.

Stage II:

 Is a stage of diminishing returns MP starts declining until it reaches zero. Total
product increases but at a diminishing rate and reaches maximum when MP = 0.

 Once optimum capital-labour ratio is reduced additional workers have less and less
tools to work with. Consequently, the productivity of the marginal worker eventually
decreases.
Firms should operate in this stage because optimal utilization of factors is realized.

Stage III:

 It is the Stage of declining returns

 TP is declining and MP is negative.

 It will be very illogical for a firm to operate in this stage because employment of
additional labour adds nothing to total product.

 Thus, stages I and III are irrational stages of operation. In stage I, capital is under
utilized by small units of labour.

 In stage III, capital is over utilized/overburdened by large units of labour.

Both extremes are uneconomical to operate in firms will thus operate in stage II, where
MP is positive for both variables & fixed factors of production.

ISOQUANT ANALYSIS
 In the short-run, we assume that one factor of production remain fixed as the other

one varies that is Q=f(K,L)
 However, in the long-run, all factors of production become variable so that

Q= f(K,L). In isoquant analysis, all factors are assumed to be variable.
What is an isoquant?
It can be defined as a curve joining various combinations of inputs that yield a given
amount of output.

 Combination of inputs (a) and (b) yield same level of output.
 A higher isoquant to the right represents superior output (Q 2 >Q 1 )
 The slope of the isoquant 

SHAPES OF ISOQUANTS

Isoquants may assume various shapes depending on the degree of substitutability.

Linear isoquant
It reflects perfect substitution between factors of production i.e. Q could be produced
wholly by using only capital and zero units of labor.
It represents infinite methods of production, which in economic analysis is unrealistic
assumption.

Input- output isoquant (Leontief isoquant)
 In this group of isoquants input cannot be substituted for one another.
 There exists only one single production process (P).
 All efficient production must take place at the corner of the isoquant (point A).
the input combination represented by points B and C yield the same output as
point A, but the A combination enables the use of less capital than the B
combination with the same labour, or less labour than the C combination with
capital the same.

Assume continuous substitutability between K and L over a certain range AB, beyond

simpler to handle by the rules of calculus.

E.g. to get its slope we differentiate the equation
L

CHARACTERISTICS OF ISOQUANTS

Are downwards sloping within the relevant range. Increasing one factor would
require that the other factor be decreasing to yield same level of output.
Isoquants do not intersect.
If the two intersect it means that combination of K and L at point T would yield
higher output Q 2 as well as Q 1 which may not be the case.
Superior isoquants are represented by those far away from the graph origin.

Isoquants are convex to the origin within the relevant range. This implies that the

slope of the isoquant decreases (in absolute terms) as we move downwards along the
isoquant, showing the increasing difficulty in substituting K for L.

PROVING THAT RELEVANT RANGE OF PRODUCTION IS IN THE SECTION
OF THE ISOQUANT WHICH IS NEGATIVELY SLOPED AND CONVEX
 Outside the ridge line, the marginal products of factors are negative and the methods
of production are inefficient, since they require more quantity of both factors for
producing a given level of output.
 Suppose the quantity represented by isoquant Q 3 is to be produced using a minimum
amount of labour (OL 2 ). With OL 2 units of labour, OK 6 units of capital must be
used.
 Beyond this level of input, additional units of capital in combination with OL 2 units of
labour (e.g. OK 7 units of capital would yield a smaller level of output Q 2.
 Notice point g in the figure lies on a lower isoquant than Q 3.
 Since an expansion of capital input beyond OK 6 in the face of the constant labour
inputs OL 2 , reduce total output, point c on Q 3 represent the intensive margin for
capital. At point c MPl= 0 but beyond point c, MP K< 0 (negative)

isoquant than Q 3. At point f, MP L= 0 , and beyond point f, MPK< 0 (negative). At

 The only efficient range of production is thus inside the ridge lines, hence the ridge

lines separate the economic from uneconomic region of production.
 In the relevant range the isoquant is convex to the origin.

THE LAW OF RETURN TO SCALE
This is a long-term analysis of production it shows by how much total output will change

as a result of a change in all factor inputs by same proportion.

Suppose we start from an initial level of input and output.

X 0 =f(L,K)
And we increase all the factors by the same proportion k. We will clearly obtain a new

level of output X\*, higher than the original level X 0

X*= (kLf ,kK )
If X*increases by the same proportion kas the input, we say that there are constant

returns to scale.

If X\*increases less than proportionally with the increase in the factors, we have

decreasing returns to scale.

If X\* increases more than proportionally with the increase in the factors, we have

increasing returns to scale.

GRAPHICAL PRESENTATION OF THE RETURNS TO SCALE

Returns to scale may be shown graphically by the distance between successive, multiple-

level-of-output isoquant, that is, isoquant that show levels of output which are multiples

of same base level of output, e.g. X2, X3, X etc.

Constant returns to scale

 A line joining points a, b, c from origin is called an isocline. An isocline is a locus of
points along which the marginal rate of technical substitution is constant.

 Doubling the factor inputs achieves double the level of initial output.

 Tripling inputs achieves triple output and so on.

 The point a, defined by 2 Kand 2 L lies on an isoquant below the one showing 2 X
 Distance between the consecutive multiple isoquant increases.
Oa <ab <bc

Increasing returns to scale

 When inputs are doubled output increases by more than double.

 Distance between consecutive multiple isoquant decreases. i.e. Oa <ab <bc

 This implies in order to realize the next multiple level of output less amount of inputs
than the previous level will be required.

RETURNS TO SCALE AND HOMOGENEITY OF PRODUCTION FUNCTION

 A homogeneous function is a function such that if each of the inputs is multiplied by

a constant (k) can be completely factored out of the function.
 e.g. take production function X 0 = f(L,K)

 increase both factors L and K by same proportion k

 new level of input X\*= (kLf ,kK )

if k can be factored out so that

X\*=kvf(L,K)
 We say that the function is homogeneous of degree v. that is the power v of k is called
degree of homogeneity of the function and is a measure of the returns to scale.

 A production function is said to be homogeneous of degree n, if when inputs are

multiplied by some constant say k, the resulting output is a multiple of kntimes the
original output.
e.g. X 0 =b 0 Lb^1 Kb^2

multiplying L and K by a constant k

X\*=b 0 (kL )b^1 (kK )b^2

=k +bb^21 ,X
Here returns to scale is measured by the power of k which is (b 1 +b 2 )
Notice b 1 and b 2 are powers of factor inputs too.
If (b 1 +b 2 )= 1 constant returns to scale
This production function is sometimes called linear homogeneity
If (b 1 +b 2 )< 1 decreasing returns to scale
If (b 1 +b 2 )> 1 increasing returns to scale.

EQUILIBRIUM OF THE FIRM (CHOICE OF OPTIMAL
COMBINATION OF FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
 The goal of any firm is to maximize profit.

π=R−C
Where
R is revenue
C is cost.
 The firm strives to choose an optimal combination of factors of production that would
maximize profits.

 The problem facing the firm would be that of constrained profit maximization.

 Constrained profit maximization may take one of the following forms.

Case 1: maximize output subject to a cost constraint

Assumptions

i) Price of output is given (px)
ii) Price of factor inputs are given
i.e. w is given wage rate (price of labour)
r is given price of capital
In the case total cost (c) is given.

Therefore (c,px w,, r), implying that the profit maximization problem can be stated as

p x c
Max R c
= x⋅ −
π= −
Clearly, maximization of πis achieved in this case if x (output) is maximized, since

cand px are given constants.
Case b: maximizing profit πif output and price are given.

For example, a contractor want to build a ridge (x is given) with the maximum profit

In this case;

Maxπ=pxx−c
Maximization of profit can only be achieved by minimizing cost.

Cost function is

C=w⋅L+r⋅K
Isocost line

In the same way we derived a budget line fro consumers budget constraint, we can
derive an isocost line from the cost function.

Isocost line is a locus of all combinations of factors the firm can purchase with a given
monetary cost outlay.

Second condition is that isoquant be convex to the origin.
The law of increasing returns is also called the law of diminishing costs, The law of
increasing return states that when more and more units of a variable factor is employed,
while other factor remain fixed, there is an increase of production at a higher rate. The
tendency of the marginal return to rise per unit of variable factors employed in fixed
amounts of other factors by a firm is called the law of increasing return. An increase of
variable factor, holding constant the quantity of other factors, leads generally to improved
organization. The output increases at a rate higher than the rate of increase in the
employment of variable factor.

TOPIC 5: THE THEORY OF COSTS
At the end of the lecture, the student should:

Discuss the economic meaning of costs and profit
Distinguish between the short run, long run, fixed and variable factors

economies diseconomies of scale
Introduction
The total cost is a multivariable function ie it is determined by many factors. By way of
symbolization we can represent the cost function as;

C= f(X T,, Pf)
Where c is total cost
X is output
T is technology

Pfis price fluctuations.
For simplicity, costs are graphically shown as a function of output, C= f(X) ceteris

paribus i.e. if other factors do not change their effect on costs as shown graphically by a

shift in the cost curve.

TRADITIONAL THEORY OF COST
 Traditional theory distinguishes between the short run and the long run.

 The short run is the period during which some factor(s) is fixed, for example capital
equipments and entrepreneurship. During such a period the usage of the fixed factors
cannot be varied regardless of the level of output. Similarly, there are other inputs,
variable inputs, whose usage can be changed, e.g. unskilled workers and raw
materials.

 In the long run, on the other hand, all inputs are variable. The quantity of all inputs
can be varied so as to obtain the most efficient input combination.

SHORT RUN COST

 In the short run, the firm incurs cost on fixed factors and variable factors are known
as fixed cost while cost on variable factors are known as variable cost.

This implies that

TC =TFC +TVC
TFC - total fixed cost
TVC - total variable cost
TFC does not vary with variation in the output between zero and a certain level of
output.

 TFC is graphically denoted by a straight line parallel to the output axis.

 TVC vary with variations of output. When output is zero, TVC = 0. It starts from the
origin and has an inverse S- shape.

Total cost curve shape

 Total cost have same shape as a total variable cost but doesn’t start from the origin.
Where it intersect the vertical axis depends on the value of the fixed cost.

 The TVC has an inverse S-shape it shows that the TVC first increases at a decreasing
rate and then at an increasing rate with the increase in the total output. The pattern of
change in the TVC stems directly from the law of increasing and diminishing returns
to the variable inputs.

 According to this law, at the initial stage of production worth a given fixed input,
additional variables factor is productive so that output increases at an increasing rate.

Taking total variable cost and dividing it by output would mean that average variable
cost declines.
 At optimal combination of the fixed and variable factor, marginal productivity of
additional variable factor reaches its maximum implying that average variable cost
reaches its minimum.

 Beyond an optimal combination of the fixed and variable factor(s) increased
employment of the variable factors causes productivity of the variable factor(s) to
decline and thus average variable costs to rise. TVC increases at an increasing rate.

SHAPE OF AVC
 To derive the AVC graphically, we get the slope of a line joining the origin and a
point on TVC curve.
 Line OC has the lowest slope compared to all the other lines from origin.
 At point C, AVC is at its minimum
 To the left at point C, AVC is declining
 To the right of point C, AVC is increasing at increasing rate.
 ATC can be derived in the same way as the AVC curve from TC curve.

SHAPE OF MARGINAL COST CURVE

 The MC curve is derived by getting the slope of the TC curve (which is the same at
any point as the slope of the TVC). The slope of TC is found by drawing tangent lines
at different points along the TC curve.

 At point C, MC curve is at its minimum since the slope of TC = 0.

 To the left at point C, slope of TC is declining. Thus we expect MC to be declining.

 To the right of point C, the TC curve starts rising at increasing rate. Thus MC start
rising.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ATC, AVC & MC

MC curve cuts both AVC and ATC at their minimum

(i) So long as the MC lies below the ATC curve, ATC must decline as output
expands
(ii) When MC is above ATC, the ATC will be rising
(iii) The MC cuts the ATC when ATC is at its minimum.
Same relationship can be observed between MC and AVC

 ATV and AVC do not reach their minimum at the same level of output. ATC
reaches its minimum after the AVC.
 Minimum point of the ATC occurs to the right of the minimum point of the AVC.
 This is due to the fact that ATC includes AFC and the latter falls continuously
with increases in output.
 After AVC has reached its lowest point and starts rising, its rise is over a certain
range off set by the fall in AFC so that the ATC continues to fall.
 However the rise in AVC eventually becomes greater than the fall in the AFC so
that the ATC starts increasing.

LONGRUN COSTS

LONGRUN AVERAGE COST CURVE

 In the long run planning period is long enough for a firm to be able to vary all factors
of production it uses.

 A long run is composed of a series of short run alternative situations.

 Each situation comprises of a certain quantity of a fixed input (e.g. capital) which
various units of variable inputs.

 SAC (K 1 ) is a short run average cost curve associated with K 1 units of capital input.

SAC (K 0 ) is a short run average cost curve associated with a lower amount of capital.
 If we join the minimum point of the SAC curve, LAC curve is obtained.

 The LAC curve is also known as envelope curve or planning curve because it
covers various short-run average cost curves.

 It shows the least possible cost per unit of producing various output using different
sizes of plants (capital).

For instance, for the firm to produce Q 2 units of output, it would be appropriate to employ

K 2 units of capital because it maximizes cost (SAC (K 1 ) is at its maximum). The firm
would pay a higher cost if it tried to produce Q 2 with K 1 units of capital

Summary
Short run is a period of time over which at least one factor must remain fixed. For most
of the firms, the fixed resource or factors which cannot be increased to meet the rising
demand of the good is capital i.e., plant and machinery. In the long run there is no fixed
resource. All the factors of production are variable
Total Fixed cost occur only in the short run. Total Fixed cost as the name implies is the
cost of the firm's fixed resources, Fixed cost remains the same in the short run regardless
of how many units of output are produced.
Total variable cost as the name signifies is the cost of variable resources of a firm that are
used along with the firm's existing fixed resources.
Total cost is the sum of fixed cost and variable cost incurred at each level of output

ATC = AFC + AVC

MARKET STRUCTURES
On completing this lecture, students should be able to:

Discuss characteristics of perfect competition and explain why individual firms
are price takers.
Analyze short and long run profit maximization.
Describe a monopolists demand curve
Analyze short term and long term profit maximization for a monopolist
Discuss inefficiency and price discrimination of the monopoly.
There are several forms of market structures which mainly depend on;
Degree of and concentration of buyers. Are they many, few etc?
The degree of product differentiation. Are goods identical, how different are they?
Are there barriers into the entry of the market?
Markets can be therefore be classified into four categories:

Perfectly competitive
Monopoly
Monopolistic competition
oligopoly
Profit maximization
The objective of firms is to maximize profits

The second condition simply implies that the slope of the marginal cost should be greater
than the slope of marginal revenue.

Q2 would be the equilibrium output because MR=Mc. It is the only point where
π is maximized.
At Q1 MR>MC. If output is increased, it will add more to revenue than to the
cost. This implies that increasing output would further increase profits. This
implies that increasing output would further increase profits.
At Q3 MC>MR if output is increased, one adds more to the cost than revenue.
Thus increasing output would reduce profits.
PERFECT COMPETITION
The following are the characteristics of perfect competition.

(a) Large numbers of sellers and buyers: each seller supplies only a small part of the

total quantity offered in the market. Neither the buyer nor the seller can affect the
price in the market. Price is determined by market forces of demand and supply,
and
each individual firm consider price as given.
Demand curve of individual firm would be infinitely elastic, indicating that the firm
can sell any amount of output at the prevailing market price.
Marginal revenue of firm under perfect competition will normally equal to the
price.
(b) Product homogeneity:- the product of any one seller (i.e. firm) is identical to the
product of every other firm in the market. There is no way in which a buyer could
differentiate among the products of different firms.

(c) Free entry and exit of firms:- there is no barrier to entry or exit from industry
seller and buyers are free to join or leave the market whenever they want.

(d) Profit maximization:- all firms in the industry aim to maximize profit. No other
goals are pursued.

(e) No government regulation:- government does not interfere with the market
through imposing tariffs, subsidies etc. the forces of demand and supply are the
ones which are left to bring the market back to equilibrium.

(f) Free mobility of factors of production:- factors of production are free to move
from one firm to another through out the economy. Labour is not unionized.

(g) Perfect knowledge. All sellers and buyers have complete knowledge of the
conditions of the market. Information is free and costless. Under these conditions
uncertainty about future development in the market is ruled out.

SHORT-RUN EQUILIBRIUM OF FIRM UNDER PERFECT COMPETITION.

The term equilibrium of the firm can be defined as a situation where the firm does not
wish to change the size of its output (i.e.) it is satisfied with the amount it is producing
and therefore there is no need to vary the size of its plant. It follows therefore that ht e
point of equilibrium of a firm is where the firm is making the highest profit and this is at

a point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue (MC =MR )

From Figure 3a, we note two points at which MC =MR , these are point v and point e.
even though point v fulfills the condition (MC =MR ), it cannot be the equilibrium point

of the firm. Since MC >MR implying that additional output adds more cost than revenue
and therefore loss. Therefore it is at point e that the producer would be at equilibrium.

The sufficient condition therefore is for the MC to cut the MR curve from below. that is,
slope of MC must be greater than slope of MR.

In the short-run, depending on the position of the average cost curve, the firm can make
excess profit or loss. In this example the firm makes excess profits represented by shaded
region PCne.

Short run equilibrium price is therefore p, and equilibrium output is Qe

In short run a firm could also make losses as shown in Figure 3b.

To show the loss, draw the SAC curve above the AR curve. Area CPEM represents the

excess loss.

LONGRUN EQUILIBRIUM OF THE FIRM

Since entry into the industry is free in case of perfect competition, the existence of excess
profits (sometimes called super normal profits) attract other firms to enter the industry.

Or alternatively, existence of excess loss would cause some firms to exit the industry.

As new firms enter the industry, supply also increases. Due to the increased supply, the
price in the market will fall and hence the price charged by the firm will also fall. The
higher profits that were being enjoyed by the firms will start to drop.

In the long run, the firm will be at equilibrium when the excess profits have been
exhausted and no new firms are attracted to enter the industry and when there are no loses
to force the firm will be in the long run equilibrium when it is only enjoying normal
profits.

A normal profit is defined as the rate of returns on capital just sufficient to provide capital
investments necessary to develop and operate a firm.

The firm would enjoy normal profits where the long run marginal cost of the firm equals

average cost and equal marginal revenue (LMC =LAC =MR =P), that is, at the point

where long run AC is at its minimum.

The supply curve of a firm is defined as the part of marginal cost curve that lies above the
average variable cost curve. From fig 3d, supply curve of firm starts from point A.

At point A, the firm is able to meet all the variable costs of the firm, i.e. costs on variable
factors of production e.g. raw materials, labour

The loss to the firm is only the fixed cost. E.g. cost on machines. If the firm stopped
production at point A it would still have to meet the fixed cost. Thus the firm should
produce something at point A because the revenue of the firms is enough for the variable
cost.

At point B, revenue derived from a price p 1 (area Op 1 Bq 2 ) meets all the variable cost and

part of fixed costs. Firm is thus advised to continue producing. At price p 2 , the firm

covers all the costs (fixed and variable cost) and in fact makes a profit.

This brings us to the conclusion that the supply curve of the firm is that part of marginal
cost curve that lies above the average variable cost curve.

MONOPOLY
CHARACTERISTICS

(a) There is a single seller
(b) The good produced has no close substitute
(c) There are barriers to entry.
Source of monopoly

(a) Ownership (sole owner) of strategic raw materials or exclusive knowledge of
some production process.
(b) Government licensing only a single firm to produce a given product (e.g.
electricity by KPLC) or the imposition of trade barriers to exclude foreign
competition.
(c) Where production involves enormous economies of scale that can only be
reaped by one firm e.g. in transport, electricity, communication and some
cases of public utilities. This may be called natural monopoly.
(d) Limiting pricing e.g. price undercutting, heavy advertisement, continuous
product differentiation etc. to create barriers to potential competition and
make entry unattractive.
DEMAND AND REVENUE CURVES FOR MONOPOLIST

Unlike in perfect competition where a firm is a price taker, so that P=MR =AR , in the
case of monopoly demand and marginal revenue will vary.

These will vary because the monopoly has the power to influence market price by
deciding on the amount of output to offer in the market for sale.

Monopolist demand curve will be down ward sloping.

SHORT RUN EQUILIBRIUM UNDER THE MONOPOLY

For monopolist to maximize his short run profit, that is be in equilibrium at point where
MR =MC. This will be at output levelQm. Price per unit charged by a monopolist is Pm

The firm makes supernormal profits represented by shaded area PmABC

LONG RUN EQUILIBRIUM UNDER MONOPOLY

In a pure monopoly, entrance into the market by potential competitor is not possible.

Thus whether or not a monopolist earns a pure profit in the short run, no other producer

can enter the market in the hope of sharing whatever pure profit exits. Therefore, pure

economic or supernormal profit is not eliminated in the long run as it is in the case of

perfect competition.

MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION.
Monopolistically competitive market is similar to a perfectly competitive market in that it
assumes many of its assumptions like existence of many firms/sellers and buyers,
freedom of entry, exit etc.

However it differs from perfect competition in that the product is differentiated and not
homogeneous. Each firm in the market sells a brand of the product that differs in quality,
appearance or reputation, and it is the sole producer of its brand or of the particular brand.

Examples of the monopolistic competitive market may include markets for toothpaste,
soap and detergents etc.

Summarized characteristics of monopolistic competition.

(a) Many sellers and buyers in the group
(b) Products of the sellers are differentiated but highly substitute.
(c) There is free entry and exit of firms in the group.
(d) The goal of the firm is profit maximization both in the short run and in the
long run.
(e) Price of factors and technology are given.
The demand curve of a monopolistic competitive firm is highly elastic but not perfectly
elastic.

Sellers can charge a different price from one another but these differences in prices are
not big because the goods are close substitutes

SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM UNDER MONOPOLISTIC
COMPETITION

Figure 4(a) indicates the short-run equilibrium of a monopolistic firm. Here the behavior
of the firm is just like a monopoly which maximizes profit by equating MR and MC. This
would be at point E. the firm produces output OQ s in the short-run, and charges a

price OP s. The firm makes supernormal profits represented by area PsXNAC.

The firm isable to make supernormal profits in the short-run because its product is
differentiated from rival products, and the time is short enough so that no rival firm could
change its strategy in the short-run.
However this situation may not continue for longer period. Since entry into the industry

is free, new firms will enter the market whenever they find occurrence of the short-run

economic profit for the existing firms.

This results in a competitive adjustment process in the market which stops at the point
when the profit margin completely vanishes from the market for every firm. (i.e. firms
earn normal profits) this situation will be called the long-run equilibrium of the
monopolistic firm.

Long-run equilibrium will be at point X 1 in figure 6(b), when the demand curve is

tangent to the average cost curve, showing no profit no loss situation.

The tangency point showing the long-run equilibrium will be before the minimum of the
average cost curve because the demand curve is downwards sloping though elastic in
nature.

Unlike in perfect competition where long-run equilibrium condition was for
P=AC =MC =MR , for monopolistic competitive firm, MR =MC and P=AC. This

means that just below point X 1 in figure 6 (b), the MR =MC condition will be satisfied.

OLIGOPOLY MARKET STRUCTURE
This is a market structure characterized by few large seller/form that supply the whole
market. The product they sell may or may not be differentiated.

If it is differentiated, the market structure is called differentiated oligopoly. The
products they sell are differentiated in the minds of customers by say branding but these
products are close substitutes as is the case with monopolistic market structure/
competition.

If the products are identical, the market structure is called pure or perfect oligopoly.
Buyers have little cause for preferring the product of one producer to that of another (e.g.
petroleum products of different oil companies). Examples of markets under oligopoly
include markets for aluminum processing, glass, petroleum, automobile assembling etc.

Characteristics

Few sellers in the market
Demand curve of oligopolistic producers is a kinked demand curve as shown in the
diagram below
In the above diagram, it can be seen that the demand curve is kinked at point A and AB
of the demand curve shows elastic demand situation, while AC shows an inelastic
demand situation.

This is because under normal circumstances if an oligopolistic producer increased the

price above P 1 the consumer will respond by cutting down the consumption of their

commodity by large amount and therefore AB of the demand curve has to show a fairly
elastic demand situation.
On the other hand, if the oligopolistic producer decides to reduce his price below P 1 other
sellers would also reduce their price such that he would not be able to increase his sale by
a greater proportion hence the portion AC of demand curve has to show an inelastic
demand situation.
There is price rigidity in oligopolistic market. This is mainly because an oligopolistic
producer cannot predict the reaction of other producers in the market in case he raised
or lowered the prices.
Because sellers are few sometimes they can come together and form one organization
the aim being to be able to control price fall by controlling the supply of their
commodities in the market. When sellers come in one organization with the aim of
controlling supply we say that they have formed a cartel organization.
Oligopolistic producers normally try to influence the demand they face through
vigorous advertisement campaign.
EQUILIBRIUM IN OLIGOPOLISTIC FIRM
 Due to the kink in the demand curve of the oligopolist, his MR curve is discontinuous
at the level of output corresponding to the kink.
 The MR has two segments: segment DR corresponds to the upper part of the demand
curve, while the segment from point S corresponds to the lower part of the kinked-
demand curve.

 Equilibrium of the firm is defined by the point of the kink because at any point to the
left of the kink MC is below the MR, while to the right of the kink the MC is larger
than the MR. thus total profit is maximized at the point of the kink.

 However, this equilibrium is not necessary defined by the intersection of the MC and
the MR curve. Intersection of the MC with the MR segment requires abnormal high
or abnormally low cost, which are rather rare in practice. The discontinuity (between
raids) of the MR curve implies that there is a range within which cost may change
without getting the equilibrium P* and Q* of the firm.

 In the figure, as long as MC passes through the segment RS, the firm maximize its

profits by producing P* and Q*. Thus the kink can explain why price and output will
not change despite changes in cost (within the range RS defined by the discontinuity
of the MR curve).
