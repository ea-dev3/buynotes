This is a fork of https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default which shows how to use Netlify Identity and Netlify Functions (via [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-hackathon-starter&utm_campaign=devex)) with Gatsby. Start here for your next JAMstack hackathon or use this as a reference implementation.

Features:

- 🚋Serverless Functions
- 🔏Authentication (with Netlify Identity)
- 🔐Authenticated Serverless Functions
- 😻External Provider login with GitHub, Bitbucket, Google, etc.
- 🏠Protected Routes
- 👋🏼Dynamic Clientside Pages in Gatsby (enabling all the above)
- 🕵🏼‍♂️Hide API Secrets from being exposed to Frontend

## Make this yourself

You may not need this starter repo! Learn how to add Netlify Identity and Functions to your own existing Gatsby project. 


- [May 2019 livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrSoLMmQ46k&feature=youtu.be) Note: this doesn't include Netlify Dev.
- Check our post on the Gatsby blog: [Turning the Static Dynamic: Gatsby + Netlify Functions + Netlify Identity](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-12-17-turning-the-static-dynamic/)

## How to start

You can clone and deploy this sample project with one click:
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sw-yx/jamstack-hackathon-starter&stack=cms&utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-hackathon-starter&utm_campaign=devex)

Basically these are the extra dependencies it adds:

- [`netlify-lambda`](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda): For installing dependencies of Netlify Functions when deploying
- [`react-netlify-identity-widget`](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity-widget): For adding Netlify Identity authentication easily on any React site

For local development, first make sure you have Netlify CLI:

```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli

## if you are totally new, you will probably need to log in, e.g.
netlify login
```

And then you can run this project with:

```bash
netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

This starts up both the Gatsby server (at port 8000) and a functions server (at a randomly selected port) and proxies them for you to a new port (usually port 8888). So make sure you go to `http://localhost:8888` to have the project work

You can read the [Netlify Dev docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-jamstack&utm_campaign=devex#netlify-dev-beta) for more info.

## Enabling Netlify Identity

If you are not using the [**Deploy to Netlify**](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sw-yx/jamstack-hackathon-starter&stack=cms&utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-hackathon-starter&utm_campaign=devex) button (which has the `&stack=cms` query param at the end that automatically sets Netlify Identity up for you), you will have to enable Netlify Identity manually yourself. Just head to `https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE_HERE/identity` and enable it, so that your `netlify-identity-widget` works.
